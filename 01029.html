<h1>HYMN XXIX. Indra.</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn">
<p>O SOMA DRINKER, ever true, utterly hopeless though we be, Do thou, O Indra, give us hope of beauteous horses and of kine, In thousands, O most wealthy One.</p><p>O Lord of Strength, whose jaws are strong, great deeds are thine, the powerful: Do thou, O Indra, give us hope of beauteous horses and of kine, In thousands, O most wealthy One.</p><p>Lull thou asleep, to wake no more, the pair who on each other look Do thou, O Indra, give us hope of beauteous horses and of kine, In thousands, O most wealthy One.</p><p>Hero, let hostile spirits sleep, and every gentler genius wake: Do thou, O Indra, give us hope of beauteous horses and of kine, In thousands, O most wealthy One.</p><p>Destroy this ass, O Indra, who in tones discordant brays to thee: Do thou, O Indra, give us hope of beauteous horses and of kine, In thousands, O most wealthy One.</p><p>Far distant on the forest fall the tempest in a circling course! Do thou, O Indra, give us hope of beauteous horses and of kine, In thousands, O most wealthy One.</p><p>Slay each reviler, and destroy him who in secret injures us: Do thou, O Indra, give us hope of beauteous horses and of kine In thousands, O most wealthy One.  </p>
