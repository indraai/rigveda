<h1>HYMN LXVI. Agni.</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn">
<p>LIKE the Sun's glance, like wealth of varied sort, like breath which is the life, like one's own son, Like a swift bird, a cow who yields her milk, pure and refulgent to the wood he speeds.</p><p>He offers safety like a pleasant home, like ripened corn, the Conqueror of men. Like a Seer lauding, famed among the folk; like a steed friendly he vouchsafes us power.</p><p>With flame insatiate, like eternal might; caring for each one like a dame at home; Bright when he shines forth, whitish mid the folk, like a car, gold-decked, thundering to the fight.</p><p>He strikes with terror like a dart shot forth, e&#146;en like an archer's arrow tipped with flame; Master of present and of future life, the maidens&#146; lover and the matrons&#146; Lord.</p><p>To him lead all your ways: may we attain the kindled God as cows their home at eve. He drives the flames below as floods their swell: the rays rise up to the fair place of heaven.  </p>
