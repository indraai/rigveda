<h1>HYMN XXXVIII. Maruts.</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn">
<p>WHAT now? When will ye take us by both hands, as a dear sire his son, Gods, for whom sacred grass is clipped?</p><p>Now whither? To what goal of yours go ye in heaven, and not on earth? Where do your cows disport themselves?</p><p>Where are your newest favours shown? Where, Maruts, your prosperity? Where all your high felicities?</p><p>If, O ye Maruts, ye the Sons whom P&#7771;&#347;ni bore, were mortal, and Immortal he who sings your praise.</p><p>Then never were your praiser loathed like a wild beast in pasture-land, Nor should he go on Yama's path.</p><p>Let not destructive plague on plague hard to be conquered, strike its down: Let each, with drought, depart from us.</p><p>Truly, they the fierce and mighty Sons of Rudra send their windless Rain e&#146;en on the desert places.</p><p>Like a cow the lightning lows and follows, motherlike, her youngling, when their rain-flood hath been loosened.</p><p>When they inundate the earth they spread forth darkness e&#146;en in day time, with the water-laden rain-cloud.</p><p>O Maruts, at your voice's sound this earthly habitation shakes, and each man reels who dwells therein.</p><p>O Maruts, with your strong-hoofed steeds, unhindered in their courses, haste Along the bright embanked streams.</p><p>Firm be the fellies of your wheels, steady your horses and your cars, and may your reins be fashioned well.</p><p>Invite thou hither with this song, for praise, Agni the Lord of Prayer, Him who is fair as Mitra is.</p><p>Form in thy mouth the hymn of praise expand thee like, a rainy cloud Sing forth the measured eulogy.</p><p>Sing glory to the Marut host, praiseworthy, tuneful, vigorous: Here let the Strong Ones dwell with us.  </p>
