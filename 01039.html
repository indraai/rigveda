<h1>HYMN XXXIX Maruts.</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn">
<p>WHEN thus, like flame, from far away, Maruts, ye cast your measure forth, to whom go Ye, to whom, O shakers of the earth, moved by whose wisdom, whose design?</p><p>Strong let your weapons be to drive away your foes, firm for resistance let them be.</p><p>Yea, passing glorious must be your warrior might, not as a guileful mortal's strength.</p><p>When what is strong ye overthrow, and whirl about each ponderous thing, Heroes, your course is through the forest trees of earth, and through the fissures of the rocks.</p><p>Consumers of your foes, no enemy of yours is found in heaven or on the earth: Ye Rudras, may the strength, held in this bond, be yours, to bid defiance even now.</p><p>They make the mountains rock and reel, they rend the forest-kings apart. Onward, ye Maruts, drive, like creatures drunk with wine, ye, Gods with all your company.</p><p>Ye to your chariot have yoked the spotted deer: a red deer, as a leader, draws. Even the Earth herself listened as ye came near, and men were sorely terrified.</p><p>O Rudras, quickly we desire your succour for this work of ours. Come to us with your aid as in the days of old, so now for frightened Ka&#7751;va's sake.</p><p>Should any monstrous foe, O Maruts, sent by you or sent by mortals threaten us, Tear ye him from us with your power and with your might, and with the succours that are yours.</p><p>For ye, the worshipful and wise, have guarded Ka&#7751;va perfectly. O Maruts, come to us with full protecting help, as lightning flashes seek the rain.</p><p>Whole strength have ye, O Bounteous Ones; perfect, earth-shakers, is your might. Maruts, against the poet's wrathful enemy send ye an enemy like a dart.  </p>
