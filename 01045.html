<article class="feecting-box hymn">
<p>WORSHIP the Vasus, Agni! here, the Rudras, the &#256;dityas, all Who spring from Manu, those who know fair rites, who pour their blessings down.</p><p>Agni, the Gods who understand give ear unto the worshipper: Lord of Red Steeds, who lovest song, bring thou those Three-and-Thirty Gods.</p><p>O J&#257;tavedas, great in act, hearken thou to Praska&#7751;va's call, as Priyamedha erst was heard, Atri, Vir&#363;pa, A&#7749;giras.</p><p>The sons of Priyamedha skilled in lofty praise have called for help On Agni who with fulgent flame is Ruler of all holy rites.</p><p>Hear thou, invoked with holy oil, bountiful giver of rewards, these eulogies, whereby the sons of Ka&#7751;va call thee to their aid.</p><p>O Agni, loved by many, thou of fame most wondrous, in their homes Men call on thee whose hair is flame, to be the bearer of their gifts.</p><p>Thee, Agni, best to find out wealth, most widely famous, quick to hear, Singers have stablished in their rites Herald and ministering Priest.</p><p>Singers with Soma pressed have made thee, Agni, hasten to the feast, Great light to mortal worshipper, what time they bring the sacred gift.</p><p>Good, bounteous, Son of Strength, this day seat here on sacred grass the Gods Who come at early morn, the host of heaven, to drink the Soma juice</p><p>Bring with joint invocations thou, O Agni, the celestial host: Here stands the Soma, bounteous Gods drink this expressed ere yesterday.  </p>
