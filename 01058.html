<h1>HYMN LVIII. Agni.</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn">
<p>NE&#146;ER waxeth faint the Immortal, Son of Strength, since he, the Herald, hath become Vivasv&#257;n's messenger. On paths most excellent he measured out mid-air: he with oblation calls to service of the Gods.</p><p>Never decaying, seizing his appropriate food, rapidly, eagerly through the dry wood he spreads. His back, as he is sprinkled, glistens like a horse: loud hath he roared and shouted like the heights of heaven?</p><p>Set high in place o&#146;er all that Vasus, Rudras do, immortal, Lord of riches, seated as High Priest; Hastening like a car to men, to those who live, the God without delay gives boons to be desired.</p><p>Urged by the wind be spreads through dry wood as he lists, armed with his tongues for sickles, with a mighty roar. Black is thy path, Agni, changeless, with glittering waves! when like a bull thou rushest eager to the trees.</p><p>With teeth of flame, wind-driven, through the wood he speeds, triumphant like a bull among the herd of cows, with bright strength roaming to the everlasting air: things fixed, things moving quake before him as he flies.</p><p>The Bh&#7771;gus established thee among mankind for men, like as a treasure, beauteous, easy to invoke; Thee, Agni, as a herald and choice-worthy guest, as an auspicious Friend to the Celestial Race.</p><p>Agni, the seven tongues' deftest Sacrificer, him whom the priests elect at solemn worship, the Herald, messenger of all the Vasus, I serve with dainty food, I ask for riches.</p><p>Grant, Son of Strength, thou rich in friends, a refuge without a flaw this day to us thy praisers. O Agni, Son of Strength, with forts of iron preserve thou from distress the man who lauds thee.</p><p>Be thou a refuge, Bright One, to the singer, a shelter, Bounteous Lord, to those who worship. Preserve the singer from distress, O Agni. May he, enriched with prayer, come soon and early.  </p>
