<h1>RigVeda Hymn 09101</h1>

<main>
<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>FOR first possession of your juice, for the exhilarating drink, Drive ye away the dog, my friends, drive ye the long-tongued dog away.</p><p>He who with purifying stream, effused, comes flowing hitherward, Indu, is like an able steed.</p><p>The men with all-pervading song send unassailable Soma forth, by pressing-stones, to offering.</p><p>The Somas, very rich in sweets, for which the sieve is destined, flow, Effused, the source of Indra's joy. May your strong juices reach the Devas.</p><p>Indu flows on for Indra's sake: thus have the Deities declared.</p><p>The Lord of Speech exerts himself, Ruler of all, because of might.</p><p>Inciter of the voice of song, with thousand streams the ocean flows, Even Soma, Lord of opulence, the Friend of Indra, day by day.</p><p>As P&#363;&#7779;an, fortune, Bhaga, comes this Soma while they make him pure. He, Lord of the multitude, hath looked upon the Earth and Heaven.</p><p>The dear cows lowed in joyful mood together to the gladdening drink. The drops as they were purified, the Soma juices, made then paths.</p><p>O Pavamana, bring the juice, the mightiest, worthy to be famed, Which the Five Tribes have over them, whereby we may win opulence.</p><p>For us the Soma juices flow, the drops best furtherers of our weal, Effused as friends without a spot, benevolent, finders of the light.</p><p>Effused by means of pressing-stones, upon the ox-hide visible, they, treasure-finders, have announced food unto us from every side.</p><p>Tlese Soma juices, skilled in song, purified, blent with milk and curd, when moving and when firmly laid in oil, resemble lovely Suns.</p><p>Let not the power of men restrain the voice of the outpouring juice: As Bh&#7771;gu's sons chased Makha, so drive ye the greedy hound away.</p><p>The Friend hath wrapped him in his robe, as in his parents arms, a son. He went, as lover to a dame, to take his station suitor-like.</p><p>That Hero who produces strength, he who hath propped both worlds apart, Gold-hued, hath wrapped him in the sieve, to settle, priest-like, in his place.</p><p>Soma upon the ox's skin through the sheep's wool flows purified. Bellowing out, the Tawny Steer goes on to Indra's special place.</p>
