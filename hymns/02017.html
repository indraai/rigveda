<h2>HYMN XVII. Indra.</h2>

<main>
<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>LIKE the A&#7749;girases, sing this new song forth to him, for, as in ancient days, his mighty powers are shown, when in the rapture of the Soma he unclosed with strength the solid firm-shut stables of the kine.</p><p>Let him be even that Deva who, for the earliest draught measuring out his power, increased his majesty; Hero who fortified his body in the wars, and through his greatness set the Heaven upon his head.</p><p>Thou didst perform thy first great deed of hero might what time thou showedst power, through prayer, before this folk.</p><p>Hurled down by thee the car-borne Lord of Tawny Steeds, the congregated swift ones fled in sundry ways.</p><p>He made himself by might Lord of all living things, and strong in vital power waxed great above them all. He, borne on high, o&#146;erspread with light the Heaven and Earth, and, sewing up the turbid darkness, closed it in.</p><p>He with his might made firm the forward-bending hills, the downward rushing of the waters he ordained. Fast he upheld the Earth that nourisheth all life, and stayed the Heaven from falling by his wondrous skill.</p><p>Fit for the grasping of his arms is what the Sire hath fabricated from all kind of precious wealth. The thunderbolt, wherewith, loud-roaring, he smote down, and striking him to death laid Krivi on the Earth.</p><p>As she who in her parents' house is growing old, I pray to thee as Bhaga from the seat of all. Grant knowledge, mete it out and bring it to us here: give us the share wherewith thou makest people glad.</p><p>May we invoke thee as a liberal giver thou givest us, O Indra, strength and labours. Help us with manifold assistance, Indra: Mighty One, Indra, make us yet more wealthy.</p><p>No. May that wealthy Cow of thine, O Indra, give in return a boon to him who lauds thee. Give to thy praisers: let not fortune fail us. Lou. May we speak, with heroes, in assembly.</p>
