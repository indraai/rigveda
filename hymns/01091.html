<p>Thou, Soma, art preeminent for wisdom; along the straightest path thou art our leader.</p><p>Our wise forefathers by thy guidance, Indu, dealt out among the Devas their share of treasure.</p><p>Thou by thine insight art most wise, O Soma, strong by thine energies and all possessing, Mighty art thou by all thy powers and greatness, by glories art thou glorious, guide of mortals.</p><p>Thine are King Varu&#7751;a's eternal statutes, lofty and deep, O Soma, is thy glory. All-pure art thou like Mitra the beloved, adorable, like Aryaman, O Soma.</p><p>With all thy glories on the Earth, in Heaven, on mountains, in the plants, and in the waters,&#151; With all of these, well-pleased and not in anger, accept, O royal Soma, our oblations.</p><p>Thou, Soma, art the Lord of heroes, King, yea, V&#7771;tra-slayer thou: Thou art auspicious energy.</p><p>And, Soma, let it be thy wish that we may live an. May not die: Praise-loving Lord of plants art thou.</p><p>To him who keeps the law, both old and young, thou givest happiness, and energy that h. May live.</p><p>Guard us, King Soma, on all sides from him who threatens us: never let The friend of one like thee be harmed.</p><p>With those delightful aids which thou hast, Soma, for the worshipper,&#151; Even with those protect thou us.</p><p>Accepting this our offering and this our praise, O Soma, come, and be thou nigh to prosper us.</p><p>Well-skilled in speech we magnify thee, Soma, with our sacred songs: Come thou to us, most gracious One.</p><p>Enricher, healer of disease, wealth-finder, prospering our store, be, Soma, a good Friend to us.</p><p>Soma, be happy in our heart, as milch-kine in the grassy meads, as a young man in his own house.</p><p>O Soma, Deva, the mortal man who in thy friendship hath delight, him doth the mighty Sage befriend.</p><p>Save us from slanderous reproach, keep us., O Soma, from distress: Be unto us a gracious Friend.</p><p>Soma, wax great. From every sid. May vigorous powers unite in thee: Be in the gathering-place of strength.</p><p>Wax, O most gladdening Soma, great through all thy rays of light, and be A Friend of most illustrious fame to prosper us.</p><p>In thee be juicy nutriments united, and powers and mighty foe-subduing vigour, Waxing to immortality, O Soma: win highest glories for thyself in Heaven.</p><p>Such of thy glories as with poured oblations men honour. May they all invest our worship. Wealth-giver, furtherer with troops of heroes, sparing the brave, come, Soma, to our houses.</p><p>To him who worships Soma gives the milch-cow, a fleet steed and a man of active knowledge, Skilled in home duties, meet for holy synod, for council meet, a glory to his father.</p><p>Invincible in fight, saver in battles, guard of our camp, winner of light and water, Born amid hymns, well-housed, exceeding famous, victor, in thee will we rejoice, O Soma.</p><p>These herbs, these milch-kine, and these running waters, all these, O Soma, thou hast generated. The spacious Firmament hast thou expanded, and with the light thou hast dispelled the darkness.</p><p>Do thou, God Soma, with thy Godlike spirit, victorious, win for us a share of riches. Let none prevent thee: thou art Lord of valour. Provide for both sides in the fray for booty.</p>
