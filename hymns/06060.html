Indra and Agni, show yourselves among us with your supreme and unrestricted bounties.</p><p>I call the Twain whose deeds of old have all been famed in ancient days O Indra and Agni, harm us not.</p><p>The Strong, the scatterers of the foe, Indra and Agni, we invoke; May they be kind to one like me.</p><p>They subdue our Ä€rya foes, these Lords of heroes, subdue our Dasyu foes And drive our enemies away.</p><p>Indra and Agni, these our songs of praise have sounded forth to you: Ye who bring blessings! drink the juice.</p><p>Come, Indra and Agni, with those teams, desired of many, which ye have, O Heroes, for the worshipper.</p><p>With those to this libation poured, ye Heroes, Indra and Agni, come: Come ye  juice.</p><p>Glorify him who compasses all forests with his glowing flame, and leaves them blackened with his tongue.</p><p>He who gains Indra's bliss with fire enkindled finds an easy way Over the floods to happiness.</p><p>Give us fleet coursers to convey Indra and Agni, and bestow Abundant strengthening food on us.</p><p>Indra and Agni, I will call you hither and make you joyful with the gifts I offer. Ye Twain are givers both of food and riches: to win me strength and vigour I invoke you.</p><p>Come unto us with riches, come with wealth in horses and in kine. Indra and Agni, we invoke you boths, as Friends for friendship, bringing bliss.</p><p>Indra and Agni, hear his call who worships. with libations poured. Come and enjoy the offerings, drink the sweetly-flavoured Soma juice.</p>
