<h2>HYMN LVI. Indra.</h2>

<main>
<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>FOR this man's full libations held in ladles, he hath roused him, eager, as a horse to meet the mare.</p><p>He stays his golden car, yoked with Bay Horses, swift,  which strengthens for great deeds.</p><p>To him the guidance-following songs of praise flow full, as those who seek gain go in company to the flood. To him the Lord of power, the holy synod's might, as to a hill, with speed, ascend the loving ones.</p><p>Victorious, great is he; in manly battle shines, unstained with dust, his might, as shines a mountain peak; Wherewith the iron one, fierce e&#146;en against the strong, in rapture, fettered wily &#346;ush&#7751;a fast in bonds.</p><p>When strength, made more strong for help by thee, waits upon Indra , then he who with his might unflinching kills the gloom stirs up the dust aloft, with joy and triumphing.</p><p>When thou with might, upon the framework of the Heaven, didst fix, across, air's region firmly, unremoved. In the light-winning war, Indra, in rapturous joy, thou smotest V&#7771;tra dead and broughtest floods of rain.</p><p>Thou with thy might didst grasp, the holder-up of Heaven, thou who art mighty also in the seats of Earth. Thou, gladdened by the juice, hast set the waters free, and broken V&#7771;tra's stony fences through and through.</p>
