<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>REVERING in our heart Agni Vaiśvānara, the finder of the light, whose promises are true, the liberal, gladsome, car-borne Deva we Kuśikas invoke him with oblation, seeking wealth with songs.</p><p>That Agni, bright we invoke for help, and Mātariśvan worthy of the song of praise; Soma for man's observance of the Devas, the Singer prompt to hear, the swiftly-moving guest.</p><p>Age after age Vaiśvānara, neighing like a horse, is kindled with the women by the Kuśikas.</p><p>May Agni, he who wakes among Immortal Devas, grant us heroic strength and wealth in noble steeds.</p><p>Let them go forth, the strong, as flames of fire with might. Gathered for victory they have yoked their spotted deer. Pourers of floods, the Devas, Masters of all wealth, they who can ne’er be conquered, make the mountains shake.</p><p>The Devas, Friends of men, are glorious as the fire: their mighty and resplendent assist we implore. Those storming Sons of Soma clothed in robes of rain, boon-givers of good gifts, roar as the lions roar.</p><p>We, band on band and troop following troop, entreat with fair lauds Agni's splendour and the Devas’ might, with spotted deer for steeds, with wealth that never fails, they, wise Ones, come to offering at our gatherings.</p><p>Agni am I who know, by birth, all creatures. Mine eye is butter, in my mouth is nectar. I am light threefold, measurer of the region exhaustless heat am I, named burnt-oblation.</p><p>Bearing in mind a thought with light accordant, he purified the Sun with three refinings; By his own nature gained the highest treasure, and looked abroad over the Earth and Heaven.</p><p>The Spring that fails not with a hundred streamlets, Father inspired of prayers that men should utter, the Sparkler, joyous in his Parents' bosorn, -him, the Truth-speaker, sate ye, Earth and Heaven.</p>
