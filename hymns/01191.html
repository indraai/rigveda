<h1>HYMN CXCI. Water. Grass. Sun.</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>VENOMOUS, slightly venomous, or venomous aquatic worm,— Both creatures, stinging, unobserved, with poison have infected me.</p><p>Coming, it kills the unobserved; it kills them as it goes away, It kills them as it drives them off, and bruising bruises them to death.</p><p>Sara grass, Darbha, Kuśara, and Sairya, Muñja, Vīraṇa, Where all these creatures dwell unseen, with poison have infected me.</p><p>The cows had settled in their stalls, the beasts of prey had sought their lairs, Extinguished were the lights of men, when things unseen infected me.</p><p>Or these, these reptiles, are observed, like lurking thieves at evening time.</p><p>Seers of all, themselves unseen: be therefore very vigilant.</p><p>Heaven is your Sire, your Mother Earth, Soma your Brother, Aditi Your Sister: seeing all, unseen, keep still and dwell ye happily.</p><p>Biters of shoulder or of limb, with needle-stings, most venomous, Unseen, whatever y. May be, vanish together and be gone.</p><p>Slayer of things unseen, the Sun, beheld of all, mounts, eastward, up, Consuming all that are not seen, and evil spirits of the night.</p><p>There hath the Sun-God mounted up, who scorches much and everything. Even the Āditya from the hills, all-seen, destroying things unseen.</p><p>I hang the poison in the Sun, a wine-skin in a vintner's house, He will not die, nor shall we die: his path is far: he whom Bay Horses bear hath turned thee to sweet meath.</p><p>This little bird, so very small, hath swallowed all thy poison up. She will not die, nor shall we die: his path is far: he whom Bay Horses bear hath turned thee to sweet meath.</p><p>The three-times-seven bright sparks of fire have swallowed up the poison's strength. They will not die, nor shall we die: his path is far: he whom Bay Horses bear hath turned thee to sweet meath.</p><p>Of ninety rivers and of nine with power to stay the venom's course,— The names of all I have secured: his path is far: he whom Bay Horses bear hath turned thee to sweet meath.</p><p>So have the peahens three-times-seven, so have the maiden Sisters Seven Carried thy venom far away, as girls bear water in their jars.</p><p>The poison-insect is so small; I crush the creature with a stone. I turn the poison hence away, departed unto distant lands.</p><p>Forth issuing from the mountain's side the poison-insect spake and said: Scorpion, they venom is but weak.</p>
