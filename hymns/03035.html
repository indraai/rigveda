<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>MOUNT the Bay Horses to thy chariot harnessed, and come to us like V&#257;yu with his coursers.</p><p>Thou, hastening to us, shalt drink the Soma. Hail, Indra. We have poured it for thy rapture.</p><p>For him who is invoked by many, the two swift Bay Steeds to the pole I harness, that they in fleet cours. May bring Indra hither, e&#146;en to this offering arranged completely.</p><p>Bring the strong Steeds who drink the warm libation, and, Bull of Godlike nature, be thou gracious. Let thy Steeds eat; set free thy Tawny Horses, and roasted grain like this consume thou daily.</p><p>Those who are yoked by prayer I harness, fleet friendly Bays who take their joy together. Mounting thy firm and easy car, O Indra, wise and all-knowing come thou to the Soma.</p><p>No other worshippers must stay beside them thy Bays, thy vigorous and smooth-backed Coursers. Pass by them all and hasten onward hither pressed we will prepare to feast thee.</p><p>Thine is this Soma: hasten to approach it. Drink thou thereof, benevolent, and cease not. Sit on the sacred grass at this our worship, and take these drops into thy belly, Indra.</p><p>The grass is strewn for thee, pressed is the Soma; the grain is ready for thy Bays to feed on. To thee who lovest them, the very mighty, strong, girt by Devas, are these gifts presented.</p><p>This the sweet draught, with cows, the men, the mountains, the waters, Indra, have for thee made ready. Come, drink thereof, Sublime One, friendly-minded, foreseeing, knowing well the ways thou goest.</p><p>The Devas, they with whom thou sharedst Soma, Indra, who made thee strong and were thine army,&#151; With these accordant, eagerly desirous drink thou this Soma with the tongue of Agni.</p><p>Drink, Indra, of the juice by thine own nature, or by the tongue of Agni, O thou Holy. Accept the sacrificial gift, O &#346;akra, from the Adhvaryu's hand or from the Hotar's.</p><p>Call we on Indra, auspicious Indra, best Hero in the fight where spoil is gathered, the Strong, who listens, who.gives aid in battles, who subdues the V&#7771;tras, wins and gathers riches.</p>
