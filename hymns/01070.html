<h1>HYMN LXX. Agni.</h1>
<p>MAY we, the pious, win much food by prayer.</p>
</section>
<main>
<p>MAY we, the pious, win much food by prayer. May Agni with fair light pervade each act,&#151; He the observer of the heavenly laws of Devas, and of the race of mortal man.</p><p>He who is germ of waters, germ of woods, germ of all things that move not and that move,&#151; To him even in the rock and in the house: Immortal One, he cares for all mankind.</p><p>Agni is Lord of riches for the man who serves him readily with sacred songs.</p><p>Protect these beings thou with careful thought, knowing the races both of Devas and men.</p><p>Whom many dawns and nights, unlike, make strong, whom, born in Law, all things that move and stand,&#151; He hath been won, Herald who sits in light, making effectual all our holy works.</p><p>Thou settest value on our cows and woods: all shall bring tribute to us to the light. Men have served thee in many and sundry spots, parting, as &#146;twere, an aged father's wealth.</p><p>Like a brave archer, like one skilled and bold, a fierce avenger, so he shines in fight.</p>
