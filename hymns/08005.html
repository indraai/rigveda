<p>WHEN, even as she were present here, red Dawn hath shone from far away, she spreadeth light on every side.</p><p>Like Heroes on your will-yoked car farshining, Wonder-Workers! ye Attend, O A&#347;vins, on the Dawn.</p><p>By you, O Lords of ample wealth our songs of praise have been observed: As envoy have I brought the prayer.</p><p>Ka&#7751;vas must praise the A&#347;vins dear to many, making many glad, most rich, that the. May succour us.</p><p>Most liberal, best at winning strength, inciters, Lords of splendour who Visit the worshipper's abode.</p><p>So for devout Sudeva dew with fatness his unfailing mead, and make it rich for offering.</p><p>Hitherward running speedily with horses, as with rapid hawks, Come, A&#347;vins, to our song of praise</p><p>Wherewith the three wide distances, and all the lights that are in Heaven.</p><p>Ye traverse, and three times of night.</p><p>O Finders of the Day, that we may win us food of kine and wealth, Open the paths for us to tread.</p><p>O A&#347;vins, bring us wealth in kine, in noble heroes, and in cars: Bring us the strength that horses give.</p><p>Ye Lords of splendour, glorified, ye Wonder-Workers borne on paths Of gold, drink sweets with Somajuice.</p><p>To us, ye Lords of ample wealth, and to our wealth chiefs extend Wide shelter, ne&#146;er to be assailed.</p><p>Come quickly downward to the prayer of people whom ye favour most: Approach not unto other folk.</p><p>Ye A&#347;vins whom our minds perceive, drink of this lovely gladdening draught, the mcath which we present to you.</p><p>Bring riches hither unto us in hundreds and in thousands, source Of plenteous food, sustaining all.</p><p>Verily sages call on you, ye Heroes, in full many a place. Moved by the monks, O A&#347;vins, conic.</p><p>Men who have trimmed the sacred grass, bringing oblations and prepared, O A&#347;vins, are invoking you.</p><p>May this our hymn of praise to-day, most powerful to bring you, be, O A&#347;vins, nearest to your hearts.</p><p>The skin filled full of savoury meath, laid in the pathway of your car- O A&#347;vins, drink ye both therefrom.</p><p>For this, ye Lords of ample wealth, bring blessing for our herd, our kine, Our progeny, and plenteous food.</p><p>Ye too unclose to us like doors the strengthening waters of the sky, and rivers, ye who find the day.</p><p>When did the son of Tugra serve you, Men? Abandoned in the sea, that with winged steeds your car might fly.</p><p>Ye, O N&#257;satyas, ministered to Ka&#7751;va with repeated aid, when cast into the heated pit.</p><p>Come near with those most recent aids of yours which merit eulogy, when I invoke you, Wealthy Devas.</p><p>As ye protected Ka&#7751;va erst, Priyamedha and Upastuta, Atri, Sinjara, A&#347;vins Twain</p><p>And Amsu in decisive fight, Agastya in the fray for kine. And, in his battles, Sobhari.</p><p>For so much bliss, or even more, O A&#347;vins, Wealthy Devas, than this, We meditate white singing hymns to you.</p><p>Ascend your car with golden seat, O A&#347;vins, and with reins of gold, that reaches even to the sky.</p><p>Golden is its supporting shaft, the axle also is of gold, and both the wheels are made of gold.</p><p>Thereon, ye Lords of ample wealth, come to us even from afar, Come ye to this mine eulogy.</p><p>From far away ye come to us, A&#347;vins, enjoying plenteous food Of D&#257;sas, O Immortal Ones.</p><p>With splendour, riches, and renown, O A&#347;vins, hither come to us, N&#257;satyas, shining brilliantly.</p><p>May dappled horses, steeds who fly with pinions, bring you hitherward To people skilled in offerings.</p><p>The whcel delayeth not that car of yours accompanied by song, that cometh with a store of food.</p><p>Borne on that chariot wrought of gold, with coursers very fleet of foot, Come, O N&#257;satyas, swift as thought.</p><p>O Wealthy Devas, ye taste and find the brisk and watchful wild beast good. Associate wealth with food for us.</p><p>As such, O A&#347;vins, find for me my share of new-presented gifts, as Kasu, Cedi's son, gave me a hundred head of buffaloes, and ten thousand kine.</p><p>He who hath given me for mine own ten Kings like gold to look upon. At Caidya's feet are all the people round about, all those who think upon the shield.</p><p>No man, not any, goes upon the path on which the Cedis walk. No other prince, no folk is held more liberal of gifts than they.</p>
