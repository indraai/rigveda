<h2>HYMN LXXVII. Devas.</h2>

<main>
<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>As with their voice from cloud they sprinkle treasure so are the wise man's liberal offers.</p><p>I praise their Company that merits worship as the good Martits' priest to pay them honour.</p><p>The youths have wrought their ornaments for glory through many nights,&#151;this noble band of Devas. Like stags the Sons of Dyatis have striven onward, the Sons of Aditi grown strong like pillars.</p><p>They who extend beyond the Earth and Heaven, by their own mass, as from the cloud spreads S&#363;rya; Like mighty Heroes covetous of glory, like heavenly gallants who destroy the wicked.</p><p>When ye come nigh, as in the depth of waters, the Earth is loosened, as it were, and shaken. This your all-feedin offering approaches: come all united, fraught, as &#146;twere with offerings.</p><p>Ye are like horses fastened to the chariot poles, luminous with your beams, with splendour as at dawn; Like self-bright falcons, punishers of wicked men, like hovering birds urged forward, scattering rain around.</p><p>When ye come forth, O Devas, from the distance, from the great treasury of rich possessions, Knowing, O Devas, boons that should be granted, even from afar drive back the men who hate us.</p><p>He who, engaged in the rite's final duty brings, as a man, oblation to the Devas, Wins him life's wealthy fulness, blest with heroes: he shall be present, too, where Devas drink Soma.</p><p>For these are helps adored at offers, bringing good fortune by their name &#256;dityas. Speeding on cars let them protect our praises, delighting in our offering and worship.</p>
