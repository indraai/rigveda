<h2>HYMN LXXXI. Visvakarman.</h2>

<main>
<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>HE who sate down as Hotar-priest, the &#7770;&#7779;i, our Father, offering up all things existing,&#151; He, seeking through his wish a great possession, came among men on Earth as archetypal.</p><p>What was the place whereon he took his station? What was it that supported him? How was it? Whence Visvakarman, seeing all, producing the Earth, with mighty power disclosed the heavens.</p><p>He who hath eyes on all sides round about him, a mouth on all sides, arms and feet on all sides, He, the Sole Deva, producing Earth and Heaven, weldeth them, with his arms as wings, together.</p><p>What was the tree, what wood in sooth produced it, from which they fashioned out the Earth and Heaven? Ye thoughtful men inquire within your spirit whereon he stood when he established all things.</p><p>Nine highest, lowest, sacrificial natures, and these thy mid-most here, O Visvakarman, Teach thou thy friends at offering, O Blessed, and come thyself, exalted, to our worship.</p><p>Bring thou thyself, exalted with oblation, O Visvakarman, Earth and Heaven to worship.</p><p>Let other men around us live in folly here let us have a rich and liberal patron.</p><p>Let us invoke to-day, to aid our labour, the Lord of Speech, the thought-swift Visvakarman. May he hear kindly all our invocations who gives all bliss for aid, whose works are righteous.</p>
