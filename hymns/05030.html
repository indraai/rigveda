<div class="box hymn"><p>WHERE is that Hero? Who hath looked on Indra borne on light-rolling car by Tawny Coursers, who, Thunderer, seeks with wealth we, and to his house goes, much-invoked, to aid him?</p><p>I have beheld his strong and secret dwelling, longing have sought the Founder's habitation.</p><p>I asked of others, and they said in answer, may we, awakened men, attain to Indra.</p><p>We will tell, Indra, when we pour libation, what mighty deeds thou hast performed to please us. Let him who knows not learn, who knows them listen: hither rides Indra with all his army.</p><p>Indra, when born, thou madest firm thy spirit: alone thou seekest war to fight with many. With might thou clavest e窶册n the rock asunder, and foundest out the stable of the Milch-kine.</p><p>When thou wast born supremest at a distance, bearing a name renowned in far-off regions, Since then e窶册n Devas have been afraid of Indra: he conquered all the floods which served the Dﾄ《a.</p><p>These blissful Devas sing their psalm to praise thee, and pour to thee libation of the Soma. Indra with wondrous powers subdued the Dragon, the guileful lurker who beset the waters.</p><p>Thou, Indra, from the first didst scatter foemen, speeding, while joying in the milk, the Giver. There, seeking man's prosperity, thou torest away the head of Namuci the Dﾄ《a.</p><p>Pounding the head of Namuci the Dﾄ《a, me, too thou madest thine associate, Indra! Yea, and the rolling stone that is in Heaven both worlds, as on a car, brought to the Devas.</p><p>Women for weapons hath the Dﾄ《a taken, what injury can his feeble armies To me? Well he distinguished his two different voices, and Indra then advanced to fight the Dasyu.</p><p>Divided from their calves the Cows went lowing around, on every side, hither and thither. These Indra re-united with his helpers, what time the well-pressed Soma made him joyful.</p><p>What time the Somas mixed by Babhru cheered him, loud the Steer bellowed in his habitations. So Indra drank thereof, the Fort-destroyer, and gave him guerdon, in return, of milch-kine.</p><p>This good deed have the Rusamas done, Agni! that they have granted me four thousand cattle. We have received Rnancaya's wealth, of heroes the most heroic, which was freely offered.</p><p>The Rusamas, O Agni, sent me homeward with fair adornment and with kine in thousands. The strong libations have made Indra joyful, when night, whose course was ending, changed to morning.</p><p>Night, well-nigh ended, at Rnancaya's coming, King of the Rusamas, was changed to morning. Like a strong courser, fleet of foot, urged onward, Babhru hath gained four thousand as his guerdon.</p><p>We have received four thousand head of cattle presented by the Rusamas, O Agni. And we, the singers, have received the caldron of metal which was heated for Pravargya.</p>
