<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>To him adorable, mighty, meet for synods, this strengthening hymn, unceasing, have they offered.</p><p>May Agni hear us with his homely splendours, hear us, Eternal One, with heavenly lustre.</p><p>To mighty Heaven and Earth I sing forth loudly: my wish goes out desirous and well knowing Both, at whose laud in synods, showing favours rejoice them with the living mortal.</p><p>O Heaven and Earth. May your great law he faithful: he ye our leaders for our high advantage. To Heaven and Earth I offer this my homage, with food, O Agni, as I pray for riches.</p><p>Yea, holy Heaven and Earth, the ancient sages whose word was ever true had power to find you; And brave men in the fightwhere heroes conquer, O Earth, have known you well and paid you honour.</p><p>What pathway leadeth to the Devas? Who knoweth this of a truth, and who will now declare it? Seen are their lowest dwelling-places only, but they are in remote and secret regions.</p><p>The Sage who looketh on mankind hath viewed them bedewed, rejoicing in the seat of Order. They make a home as for a bird, though parted, with one same will finding themselves together.</p><p>Partners though parted, with far-distant limits, on one firm place both stand forever watchful, and, being young forevermore, as sisters, speak to each other names that are united.</p><p>All living things they part and keep asunder; though bearing up the mighty Devas they reel not. One All is Lord of what is fixed and moving, that walks, that flies, this multiform creation.</p><p>Afar the Ancient from of old I ponder, our kinship with our mighty Sire and Father,&#151; Singing the praise whereof the Devas by custom stand on the spacious far-extended pathway.</p><p>This laud, O Heaven and Earth, to you I utter: let the kind-hearted hear, whose tongue is Agni, Young, Sovran Rulers, Varu&#7751;a and Mitra, the wise and very glorious &#256;dityas.</p><p>The fair-tongued Indra, the golden-handed, comes thrice from Heaven as Lord in our assembly. Bear to the Devas this song of praise, and send us, then, Indra, complete and perfect safety.</p><p>Deft worker, skiful-handed, helpful, holy. May Tva&#7779;&#7789;ar, Deva, give us these things to aid us, Take your delight, Ye &#7770;bhus joined with P&#363;&#7779;an: ye have prepared the rite with stones adjusted.</p><p>Borne on their flashing car, the spear-armed Devas, the nimble Youths of Heaven, the Sons of Order, the Holy, and Sarasvat&#299;, shall hear us: ye Mighty, give us wealth with noble offspring.</p><p>To Vi&#7779;&#7751;u rich in marvels, songs And praises shall go as singers on the road of Bhaga,&#151; The Chieftain of the Mighty Stride, whose Mothers, the many young Dames, never disregard him.</p><p>Indra, who rules through all his powers heroic, hath with his majesty filled Earth and Heaven. Lord of brave hosts, fort-crusher, V&#7771;tra-slayer, gather thou up and bring us store of cattle.</p><p>My Sires are the N&#257;satyas, kind tokinsmen: the A&#347;vins' kinship is a glorious title. For ye are they who give us store of riches: ye guard your gift uncheated by the bounteous.</p><p>This is, ye Wise, your great and glorious title, that all ye Deities abide in Indra. Friend, Much-invoked! art thou with thy dear &#7770;bhus: fashion ye this our hymn for our advantage.</p><p>Aryaman, Aditi deserve our worship: the laws of Varu&#7751;a remain unbroken. The lot of childlessness remove ye from us, and let our course be rich in kine and offspring.</p><p>May the Devas&#146; envoy, sent to many a quarter, proclaim us sinless for our perfect safety. May Earth and Heaven, the Sun, the waters, hear us, and the wide Firmament and constellations.</p><p>Hear us the mouatains which distil the rain-drops, and, resting firm, rejoice in freshening moisture. May Aditi with the &#256;dityas hear us, and Devas grant us their auspicious shelter.</p><p>Soft be our path forever, well-provisioned: with pleasant meath, O Devas, the herbs besprinkle. Safe be my bliss, O Agni, in thy friendship. May I attain the seat of foodful. riches,</p><p>Enjoy the offering: beam thou strength upon us; combine thou for our good all kinds of glory. Conquer in battle, Agni, all those foemen, and light us every day with loving kindness.</p>
