<h1>HYMN L. Indra Vaikuntha.</h1>

<p>I LAUD your Mighty One who joyeth in the juice, him who is shared by all men, who created all; Indra, whose conquering strength is powerful in war, whose fame and manly vigour Heaven and Earth revere.</p><p>He with his friend is active, lauded, good to man, Indra who must be glorified by one like me.</p><p>Hero, Lord of the brave, all cars are thy delight, warring with V&#7771;tra, or for waters, or for spoil.</p><p>Who are the men whom thou wilt further, Indra, who strive to win thy bliss allied with riches? Who urged thee forward to exert thy power divine, to valour, in the war for waters on their fields?</p><p>Thou, Indra, through the holy prayer art mighty, worthy of offering at all libations. In every fight thou castest heroes on the ground: thou art the noblest song, O Lord of all the folk.</p><p>Help now, as Highest, those who toil at offering: well do the people know thy great protecting might. Thou shalt be Everlasing, Giver of success yea, on all these libations thou bestowest strength.</p><p>All these libations thou makest effectual, of which thou art thyself supporter, Son of Power. Therefore thy vessel is to be esteemed the best, offering, holy text, prayer, and exalted speech.</p><p>They who with flowing Soma pray to thee, O Sage, to pour on them thy gifts of opulence and wealth, May they come forward, through their spirit, on the path of bliss, in the wild joy of Soma juice effused.</p>
