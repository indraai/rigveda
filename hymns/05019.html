<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>ONE state begets another state: husk is made visible from husk: Within his Mother's side he speaks.</p><p>Discerning, have they offered gifts: they guard the strength that never wastes.</p><p>To a strong fort have they pressed in.</p><p>&#346;vaitreya's people, all his men, have gloriously increased in might. A gold chain B&#7771;haduktha wears, as, through this Soma, seeking spoil.</p><p>I bring, as &#146;twere, the longed-for milk, the dear milk of the Sister-Pair. Like to a caldron filled with food is he, unconquered, conquering all.</p><p>Beam of light, come to us in sportive fashion, finding thyself close to the wind that fans thee. These flames of his are wasting flames, like arrows keen-pointed, sharpened, on his breast.</p>
