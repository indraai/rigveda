<p>THAT we may win us wealth and power we poets, verily, call on thee: In war men call on thee, Indra, the hero's Lord, in the steed's race-course call on thee.</p><p>As such, O Wonderful, whose hand holds thunder, praised as mighty, Caster of the Stone! Pour on us boldly, Indra, kine and chariotsteeds, ever to be the conqueror's strength.</p><p>We call upon that Indra, who, most active, ever subdues the foe: Lord of the brave, most Manly, with a thousand powers, help thou and prosper us in fight.</p><p>Rcisama, thou forcest men as with a bull, with anger, in the furious fray.</p><p>Be thou our Helper in the mighty battle fought for sunlight, water, and for life.</p><p>O Indra, bring us name and fame, enriching, mightiest, excellent, Wherewith, O Wondrous Deva, fair-visored, thunder-armed, thou hast filled full this Earth and Heaven.</p><p>We call on thee, O King, Mighty amid the Devas, Ruler of men, to succour us. All that is weak in us, Excellent Deva, make firm: make our foes easy to subdue.</p><p>All strength and valour that is found, Indra, in tribes of Nahusas, and all the splendid fame that the Five Tribes enjoy Bring, yea, all manly powers at once.</p><p>Or, Indra, what vigorous strength in Trksi lay, in Druhyus or in Paru's folk, Fully bestow on us, that, in the conquering fray, we may subdue our foes in fight.</p><p>O Indra, grant a happy home, a triple refuge triply strong. Bestow a dwelling-place on the rich lords and me, and keep thy dart afar from these.</p><p>They who with minds intent on spoil subdue the foe, boldly attack and smite him down,&#151; From these, O Indra Indra who lovest song, be closest guardian of our lives.</p><p>And now, O Indra, strengthen us: come near and aid us in the fight, What time the feathered shafts are flying in the air, the arrows with their sharpened points.</p><p>Give us, where heroes strain their bodies in the fight, the shelter that our fathers loved. To us and to our sons give refuge: keep afar all unobserved hostility.</p><p>When, Indra, in the mighty fray thou urgest chargers to their speed, On the uneven road and on a toilsome path, like falcons, eager for renown,</p><p>Speeding like rivers rushing down a steep descent, responsive to the urging call, that come like birds attracted to the bait, held in by reins in both the driver's hands.</p>
