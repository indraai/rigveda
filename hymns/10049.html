<h2>HYMN XLIX.Indra Vaikuntha.</h2>

<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>I HAVE enriched the singer with surpassing wealth; I have allowed the holy hymn to strengthen me.</p><p>I, furtherer of him who offers offering, have conquered in each fight the men who worship not.</p><p>The People of the heavens, the waters, and the Earth have stablished me among the Devas with Indra's name. I took unto myself the two swift vigorous Bays that speed on divers paths, and the fierce bolt for strength.</p><p>With deadly blows I smote Atka for Kavi's sake; I guarded Kutsa well with these saving helps. As &#346;u&#7779;&#7751;a's slayer I brandished the dart of death: I gave not up the &#256;ryan name to Dasyu foes.</p><p>Smadibha, Tugra, and the Vetasus I gave as prey to Kutsa, father-like, to succour him. I was a worthy King to rule the worshipper, when I gave Tuji dear inviolable gifts.</p><p>I gave up M&#7771;gaya to Srutarvan as his prey because he ever followed me and kept my laws. For &#256;yu's sake I caused Veta to bend and bow, and into Savya's hand delivered Padgrbhi.</p><p>1, I crushed Navav&#257;stva of the lofty car, the D&#257;sa, as the V&#7771;tra-slayer kills the fiends; When straightway on the region's farthest edge I brought the Deva who makes the lights to broaden and increase.</p><p>I travel round about borne onward in my might by the fleet-footed dappled Horses of the Sun. When man's libation calls me to the robe of state I soon repel the powerful Dasyu with my blows.</p><p>Stronger am I than Nabus, I who slew the seven: I glorified with might Yadu and Turvaga. I brought another low, with strength I bent his strength: I let the mighty nine-and-ninety wax in power.</p><p>Bull over all the streams that flow along the Earth, I took the Seven Rivers as mine own domain. I, gifted with great wisdom, spread the floods abroad: by war I found for man the way to high success.</p><p>I set within these cows the white milk which no Deva, not even Tva&#7779;&#7789;ar's self, had there deposited,&#151; Much-longed-for, in the breasts, the udders of the kine, the savoury sweets of meath, the milk and Soma juice.</p><p>Even thus hath Indra Indra, truly bounteous, sped Devas and men with mighty operation. The pious glorify all these thine exploits, Lord of Bay Coursers, Strong, and Selfresplendent.</p>
