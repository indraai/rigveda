<h2>HYMN XCII. Agni</h2>

<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>THAT noblest Furtherer hath appeared, to whom men bring their holy works.</p><p>Our songs of praise have risen aloft to Agni who was barn to give the &#256;rya strength.</p><p>Agni of Divod&#257;sa turned, as &#146;twere in majesty, to the Devas. Onward he sped along the mother Earth, and took his station in the height of Heaven.</p><p>Him before whom the people shrink when he performs his glorious deeds, him who wins thousands at the worship of the Devas, himself, that Agni, serve with son s.</p><p>The mortal man whom thou wouldst lead to opulence, O Vasu, he who brings thee gifts. He, Agni, wins himself a hero singing lauds, yea, one who feeds a thousand men.</p><p>He with the steed wins spoil even in the fenced fort, and gains imperishable fame. In thee, O Lord of wealth, continually we lay all precious offerings to the Devas.</p><p>To him who dealeth out all wealth, who is the cheerful Monk of men, to him, like the first vessels filled with savoury juice, to Agni go the songs of praise.</p><p>Votaries, richly-gifted, deck him with their songs, even as the steed who draws the car. On both, Strong Lord of men! on child and grandson pour the bounties which our nobles give.</p><p>Sing forth to him, the Holy, most munificent, sublime with his refulgent glow, to Agni, ye Upastutas.</p><p>Worshipped with gifts, enkindled, splendid, Indra shall win himself heroic fame. And will not his most newly shown benevolence come to us with abundant strength?</p><p>Monk, presser of the juice! praise now the dearest Guest of all our friends, Agni, the driver of the cars.</p><p>Who, finder-out of treasures open and concealed, bringeth them hither, Holy One. Whose waves, as in a cataract, are hard to pass, when he, through song, would win him strength.</p><p>Let not the noble Guest, Agni, be wroth with us: by many a man his praise is sung, Good Herald, skilled in offering.</p><p>O Vasu, Agni, let not them be harmed who come in any way with lauds to thee. Even the lowly, skilled in rites, with offered gifts, seeketh thee for the envoy's task.</p><p>Friend of the Devas, Agni, come with Somas to the Soma-draught, to Sobhar's fair song of praise, and be thou joyful in the light. VALAKHILYA</p>
