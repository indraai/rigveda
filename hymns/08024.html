<div class="box hymn"><p>COMPANIONS, let us learn a prayer to Indra. whom the thunder arms, to glorify your bold and most heroic Friend.</p><p>For thou by subduing V·πõtra art, famed for might.</p><p>Thou. Hero, in rich gifts surpassest wealthy chiefs.</p><p>As such, when glorified, bring us riches of very wondrous fame, Set in the highest rank, Wealth-giver, Lord of Bays!</p><p>Yea, Indra, thou disclosest that preeminent dear wealth of men: Boldly, O Bold One, glorified, bring it to us.</p><p>The workers of destruction stay neither thy right hand nor thy left: Nor hosts that press about thee, Lord of Bays, in fight.</p><p>O Thunder-armed, I come with songs to thee as to a stall with kine: Fulfil the wish and thought of him who sings thy praise.</p><p>Chief V·πõtra-slayer, through the hymn of Visvamanas think of all, All that concerneth us, Excellent, Mighty Guide.</p><p>May we, O Indra, O Hero, find this thy newest boon, Longed-for, and excellent, thou who art much invoked!</p><p>O Indra, Dancer, Much-invoked! as thy great power is unsurpassed, So be thy bounty to the worshipper unchecked.</p><p>Most Mighty, most heroic One, for mighty bounty fill thee full. Though strong, strengthen thyself to win wealth, Indra!</p><p>O Thunderer, never have our meditations gone forth to any Deva but thee: So help us, Indra, with thine assistance now.</p><p>For, Dancer, verily I find non else for bounty, saving thee, for splendid wealth and power, thou Lover of the Song.</p><p>For Indra pour ye out the drops meath blent with Soma let him drink With bounty and with majesty will he further us.</p><p>I spake to the Bay Coursers' Lord, to him who gives ability: Now hear the son of Asva as he praises thee.</p><p>Never was any Hero born before thee mightier than thou: None certairdy like thee in goodness and in wealth.</p><p>O ministering priest, pour out of the sweet juice what gladdens most: So is the Hero praised who ever prospers us.</p><p>Indra, whom Tawny Coursers bear, praise such as thine, preeminent, None by his power or by his goodness hath attained.</p><p>We, seeking glory, have invoked this Master of all power and might Who must be glorified by constant sacri fice.</p><p>Come, sing we praise to Indra, friends, the Hero who deserves the laud, him who with none to aid o‚Äôercomes all tribes of men.</p><p>To him who wins the kine, who keeps no cattle back, Celestial Deva, Speak wondrous speech more sweet than butter and than meath.</p><p>Whose hero powers are measureless, whose bounty ne‚Äôe. May be surpassed, whose liberality, like light, is over all.</p><p>As Vya≈õva did, praise Indra, praise the Strong unfluctuating Guide, who gives the foe's possessions to the worshipper.</p><p>Now, son of Vya≈õva, praise thou him who to the tenth time still is new, the very Wise, whom living men must glorify</p><p>Thou knowest, Indra, Thunder-armed, how to avoid destructive powers, as one secure from pitfalls each returning day.</p><p>O Indra, bring that aid wherewith of old, most Wondrous! thou didst subdue His foes for active Kutsa: send it down to us.</p><p>So now we seek thee fresh in might, most Wonderful in act! for gain: For thou art he who conquers all our foes for us.</p><p>Who will set free from ruinous woe, or ƒÄrya on the Seven Streams: O valiant Hero, bend the DƒÅsa's weapon down.</p><p>As to Varosusaman thou broughtest great riches, for their gain, to Vya≈õva's sons, Blest Lady, rich in ample wealth!</p><p>Let Narya's sacrificial meed reach Vya≈õva's Soma-bearing sons: In hundreds and in thousands be the great reward.</p><p>If one should ask thee, Where is he who offered? Whither lookest thou? Like Vala he hath passed away and dwelleth now on Gomati.</p>
