<h2>HYMN LXIX. Agni.</h2>

<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>Auspicious is the aspect of Vadhryasva's fire good is its guidance, pleasant are its visitings.</p><p>When first the people Of Sumitra kindle it, with butter poured thercon it crackles and shines bright.</p><p>Butter is that which makes Vadhryaiva's fire growstrong: the butter is its food, the butter makes it fat. It spreads abroad when butter hath been offered it, and balmed with streams of butter shines forth like the Sun.</p><p>Still newest is this face of thine, O Agni, which Manu and Sumitra have enkindled. So richly shine, accept our songs with favour, so give us strengthening food, so send us glory.</p><p>Accept this offering, Agni, whom aforetime Vadhryasva, hath entreated and enkindled. Guard well our homes and ople, guard our bodies, protect thy girt to us which thou hast granted.</p><p>Be splendid, guard us Kinsman of Vadhryasva: let not the enmity of men o&#146;ercome thee, like the bold hero Cyav&#257;na, I Sumitra tell forth the title of Vadhryaiva's Kinsman.</p><p>All treasures hast thou won, of plains and mountains, and quelled the D&#257;sas' and &#256;ryas' hatred. Like the bold hero Cyav&#257;na, O Agni. Mayst thou subdue the men who long for battle.</p><p>Deft Agni hath a lengthened thread, tall oxen, a thousand heifers, numberless devices. Decked by the men, splendid among the splendid, shine brightly forth amid devout Sumitras.</p><p>Thine is the teeming cow, O J&#257;tavedas, who pours at once her ceaseless flow, Sabardhuk, Thou. art lit up by men enriched with guerdon, O Agni, by the pious-souled Sumitras.</p><p>Even Immortal Devas, O J&#257;tavedas, Vadhryasva's Kinsman, have declared thy grandeur. When human tribes drew near with supplication thou conqueredst with men whom thou hadst strengthened.</p><p>Like as a father bears his son, O Agni, Vadhryasva bare thee in his lap and served thee. Thou, Youngest Deva, having enjoyed his fuel, didst vanquish those of old though they were mighty.</p><p>Vadhryasva's Agni evermore hath vanquished his foes with heroes who had pressed the Soma. Lord of bright rays, thou burntest up the battle, subduing, as our help, e&#146;en mighty foemen.</p><p>This Agni of Vadhryasva, V&#7771;tra-slayer, lit from of old, must be invoked with homage. As such assail our enemies, Vadhryasva, whether the foes be strangers or be kinsmen.</p>
