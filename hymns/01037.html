<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>SING forth, O Ka&#7751;vas, to your band of Devas unassailable, Sporting, resplendent on their car</p><p>They who, self-luminous, were born together, with the spotted deer, Spears, swords, and glittering ornaments.</p><p>One hears, as though &#146;twere close at hand, the cracking of the whips they hold They gather glory on their way.</p><p>Now sing ye forth the Deva-given hymn to your exultant Marut host, the fiercely-vigorous, the strong.</p><p>Praise ye the Bull among the cows; for &#146;tis the Devas&#146; sportive band: It strengthened as it drank the rain.</p><p>Who is your mightiest, Heroes, when, O shakers of the Earth and Heaven, Ye shake them like a garment's hem?</p><p>At your approach man holds him down before the fury of your wrath: The rugged-jointed mountain yields.</p><p>They at whose racings forth the Earth, like an age-weakened lord of men, Trembles in terror on their ways.</p><p>Strong is their birth: vigour have they to issue from their Mother; strength, Yea, even twice enough, is theirs.</p><p>And these, the Sons, the Singers, in their racings have enlarged the bounds, So that the kine must walk knee-deep.</p><p>Before them, on the ways they go, they drop this offspring of the cloud, Long, broad, and inexhaustible.</p><p>O Devas, as your strength is great, so have ye cast men down on Earth, So have ye made the mountains fall.</p><p>The while the Devas pass along, they talk together on the way: Doth any hear them as they speak?</p><p>Come quick with swift steeds, for ye have worshippers among Ka&#7751;va's sons May you rejoice among them well.</p><p>All is prepared for your delight. We are their servants evermore, to live as long as lif. May last.</p>
