<h1>HYMN XXXV. Indra.</h1>
<p>AGNI I first invoke for our prosperity;</p>
</section>
<main>
<p>AGNI I first invoke for our prosperity; I call on Mitra, Varu&#7751;a, to aid us here.</p><p>I call on Night who gives rest to all moving life; I call on Indra the Deva to lend us help.</p><p>Throughout the dusky Firmament advancing, laying to rest the immortal and the mortal, Borne in his golden chariot he cometh, Indra, Deva who looks on every creature.</p><p>The God moves by the upward path, the downward; with two bright Bays, adorable, he journeys. Indra comes from the far distance, and chases from us all distress and sorrow.</p><p>His chariot decked with pearl, of various colours, lofty, with golden pole hath mounted, the many-rayed One, Indra the holy, bound, bearing power and might, for darksome regions.</p><p>Drawing the gold-yoked car his Bays, white-footed, have manifested light to all the peoples. Held in the lap of Indra, divine One, all men, all beings have their place forever.</p><p>Three heavens there are; two Indra's, adjacent: in Yama's world is one, the home of heroes, as on a linch-pin, firm, rest things immortal: he who hath known it let him here declare it.</p><p>He, strong of wing, hath lightened up the regions, deep-quivering Devas, the gentle Leader. Where now is S&#363;rya, where is one to tell us to what celestial sphere his ray hath wandered?</p><p>The Earth's eight points his brightness hath illumined, three desert regions and the Seven Rivers. God Indra the gold-eyed hath come hither, giving choice treasures unto him who worships.</p><p>The golden-handed Indra, far-seeing, goes on his way between the Earth and Heaven, Drives away sickness, bids the Sun approach us, and spreads the bright sky through the darksome region.</p><p>May he, gold-handed Indra, kind Leader, come hither to us with his help and favour. Driving off R&#257;k&#7779;asas and Y&#257;tudh&#257;nas is present, praised in hymns at evening.</p><p>O Indra, thine ancient dustless pathways are well established in the air's mid-region: O Deva, come by those paths so fair to travel, preserve thou us from harm this day, and bless us.</p>
