<h1>HYMN LVII. Indra.</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>To him most liberal, lofty Lord of lofty wealth, verily powerful and strong, I bring my hymn,— Whose checkless bounty, as of waters down a slope, is spread abroad for all that live, to give them strength.</p><p>Now all this world, for worship, shall come after thee—the offerer's libations like floods to the depth, when the well-loved one seems to rest upon the hill, the thunderbolt of Indra, wrought of gold.</p><p>To him, most meet for lofty praise, now bring gifts with reverence in this rite, whose being, for renown, yea, Indra-power and light, have been created, like bay steeds, to move with speed.</p><p>Thine, Indra, praised by many, excellently rich! are we who trusting in thy help draw near to thee.</p><p>Lover of praise, none else but thou receives our laud: as Earth loves all her creatures, love thou this our hymn.</p><p>Great is thy power, O Indra, we are thine. Fulfil the wish of this thy worshipper. After thee lofty Heaven hath measured out its strength: to thee and to thy power this Earth hath bowed itself.</p><p>Thou, who hast thunder for thy weapon, with thy bolt hast shattered into pieces this broad massive cloud. Thou hast sent down the obstructed floods that they may flow: thou hast, thine own for ever, all victorious might.</p>
