<h2>HYMN VII. Agni.</h2>

<main>
<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>OFFER to Agni, O my friends, your seemly food, your seemly praise; To him supremest o&#146;er the folk, the Son of Strength, the mighty Lord:</p><p>Him in whose presence, when they meet in full assembly, men rejoice; Even him whom worthy ones inflame, and living creatures bring to life.</p><p>When we present to him the food and sacrificial gifts of men. He by the might of splendour grasps the holy Ordinance's rein.</p><p>He gives a signal in the night even to him who is afar, when he, the Bright, unchanged by eld, consumes the sovrans of the wood.</p><p>He in whose service on the ways they offer up their drops of sweat, On him is their high kin have they mounted, as ridges on the Earth.</p><p>Whom, sought of many, mortal man hath found to be the Stay of all; He who gives flavour to our food, the home of every man that lives.</p><p>Even as a herd that crops the grass he shears the field and wilderness, with flashing teeth and beard of gold, deft with his unabated might.</p><p>For him, to whom, bright as an axe he, as to Atri, hath flashed forth, Hath the well-bearing Mother borne, producing when her time is come.</p><p>Agni to whom the oil is shed by him thou lovest to support, bestow upon these mortals fame and splendour and intelligence.</p><p>Such zeal hath he, resistless one: he gained the cattle given by thee.</p><p>Agni. May Atri overcome the Dasyus who bestow no gifts, subdue the men who give no food.</p>
