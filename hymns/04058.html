<h2>HYMN LVIII. Ghṛta.</h2>

<main>
<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>FORTH from the ocean sprang the wave of sweetness: together with the stalk it turned to Amṛta, that which is holy oil's mysterious title: but the Devas’ tongue is truly Amṛta's centre.</p><p>Let us declare aloud the name of Ghṛta, and at this offering hold it up with homage.</p><p>So let the Brahman hear the praise we utter. This hath the four-horned Buffalo emitted.</p><p>Four are his horns, three are the feet that bear him; his heads are two, his hands are seven in number. Bound with a triple bond the Steer roars loudly: the mighty Deva hath entered in to mortals.</p><p>That oil in triple shape the Devas discovered laid down within the Cow, concealed by Paṇis. Indra produced one shape, Sūrya another: by their own power they formed the third from Vena.</p><p>From inmost reservoir in countless channels flow down these rivers which the foe beholds not. I look upon the streams of oil descending, and lo! the Golden Reed is there among them.</p><p>Like rivers our libations flow together, cleansing themselves in inmost heart and spirit. The streams of holy oil pour swiftly downward like the wild beasts that fly before the bowman.</p><p>As rushing down the rapids of a river, flow swifter than the wind the vigorous currents, the streams of oil in swelling fluctuation like a red courser bursting through the fences.</p><p>Like women at a gathering fair to look on and gently smiling, they incline to Agni. The streams of holy oil attain the fuel, and Jātavedas joyfully receives them.</p><p>As maidens dock themselves with gay adornment to join the bridal feast, I now behold them. Where Soma flows and offering is ready, thither the streams of holy oil are running.</p><p>Send to our eulogy a herd of cattle bestow upon us excellent possessions. Bear to the Devas the offering we offer the streams of oil flow pure and full of sweetness.</p><p>The universe depends upon thy power and might within the sea, within the heart, within all life.</p>
