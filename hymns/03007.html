<h2>HYMN VII.</h2>

<div class="box hymn"><p>THE seven tones risen from the whitebacked viand have made their way between the pair of Mothers.</p><p>Both circumjacent Parents come together to yield us length of days they hasten forward.</p><p>The Male who dwells in Heaven hath Mares and Milchkine: he came to Goddesses who bring sweet treasure. To thee safe resting in the seat of Order the Cow alone upon her way proceedeth.</p><p>Wise Master, wealthy finder-out of riches, he mounted those wh. May with case be guided. He, dark-backed, manifold with varied aspect, hath made them burst forth from their food the brush-wood.</p><p>Strength-giving streams bear hither him eternal, fain to support the mighty work. of Tvaṣṭar. He, flashing in his home with all his members, hath entered both the worlds as they were single.</p><p>They know the red Bull's blessing, and are joyful under the flaming-coloured Lord's dominion. They who give shine from heavenwith fair effulgence, whose lofty song like Iḷā must be honoured.</p><p>Yea, by tradition from the ancient sages they brought great strength from the two mighty Parents, to where the singer's Bull, the night's dispeller, after his proper law hath waxen stronger.</p><p>Seven holy singers guard with five Adhvaryus the Bird's beloved firmly-settled station. The willing Bulls, untouched by old, rejoice them: as Devas themselves the ways of Devas they follow.</p><p>I crave the grace of Heaven's two chief Invokers: the seven swift steeds joy in their wonted manner. These speak of truth, praising the Truth Eternal, thinking on Order as the guards of Order.</p><p>The many seek the great Steed as a stallion: the reins obey the Lord of varied colour. O heavenly Monk, most pleasant, full of wisdom, bring the great Devas to us, and Earth and Heaven.</p><p>Rich Lord, the Mornings have gleamed forth in splendour, fair-rayed, fair-speaking, worshipped with all offerings, Yea, with the glory of the Earth, O Agni. Forgive us, for our weal, e’en sin cornmitted.</p><p>As holy food, Agni, to thine invoker, give wealth in cattle, lasting, rich in marvels. To us be born a son, and spreading offspring Agni, be this thy gracious will to usward.</p>
