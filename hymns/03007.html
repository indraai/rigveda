<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>THE seven tones risen from the whitebacked viand have made their way between the pair of Mothers.</p><p>Both circumjacent Parents come together to yield us length of days they hasten forward.</p><p>The Male who dwells in Heaven hath Mares and Milchkine: he came to Goddesses who bring sweet treasure. To thee safe resting in the seat of Order the Cow alone upon her way proceedeth.</p><p>Wise Master, wealthy finder-out of riches, he mounted those wh. May with case be guided. He, dark-backed, manifold with varied aspect, hath made them burst forth from their food the brush-wood.</p><p>Strength-giving streams bear hither him eternal, fain to support the mighty work. of Tva&#7779;&#7789;ar. He, flashing in his home with all his members, hath entered both the worlds as they were single.</p><p>They know the red Bull's blessing, and are joyful under the flaming-coloured Lord's dominion: They who give shine from heavenwith fair effulgence, whose lofty song like I&#7735;&#257; must be honoured.</p><p>Yea, by tradition from the ancient sages they brought great strength from the two mighty Parents, to where the singer's Bull, the night's dispeller, after his proper law hath waxen stronger.</p><p>Seven holy singers guard with five Adhvaryus the Bird's beloved firmly-settled station. The willing Bulls, untouched by old, rejoice them: as Devas themselves the ways of Devas they follow.</p><p>I crave the grace of Heaven's two chief Invokers: the seven swift steeds joy in their wonted manner. These speak of truth, praising the Truth Eternal, thinking on Order as the guards of Order.</p><p>The many seek the great Steed as a stallion: the reins obey the Lord of varied colour. O heavenly Monk, most pleasant, full of wisdom, bring the great Devas to us, and Earth and Heaven.</p><p>Rich Lord, the Mornings have gleamed forth in splendour, fair-rayed, fair-speaking, worshipped with all offerings, Yea, with the glory of the Earth, O Agni. Forgive us, for our weal, e&#146;en sin cornmitted.</p><p>As holy food, Agni, to thine invoker, give wealth in cattle, lasting, rich in marvels. To us be born a son, and spreading offspring Agni, be this thy gracious will to usward.</p>
