<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>I CALL your chariot to receive united praise mid princely men, Strong Devas who pour down wealth, of never vanquished might!</p><p>Ye to Varosusaman come, N&#257;satyas, for this glorious rite.</p><p>With your protecting aid. Strong Devas, who pour down wealth.</p><p>So with oblations we invoke you, rich in ample wealth, to-day, when night hath passed, O ye who send us plenteous food. O A&#347;vins. Heroes, let your car, famed, best to travel, come to us, and, for his glory, mark your zealous servant's lauds.</p><p>A&#347;vins, who send us precious gifts, even when offended, think of him: For ye, O Somas, lead us safe beyond our foes.</p><p>For, Wonder-Workers, with fleet steeds ye fly completely round this All, Stirring our thoughts, ye Lords of splendour, honey-hued.</p><p>With all-sustaining opulence, A&#347;vins, come hitherward to us, Ye rich and noble Heroes, ne&#146;er to be o&#146;erthrown.</p><p>To welcome this mine offering, O ye Indra-like N&#257;satyas, come As Devas of best accord this day with other Devas.</p><p>For we, like Vya&#347;va, lifting up our voice like oxen, call on you: With all your loving kindness, Sages, come to us.</p><p>O &#7770;&#7779;i, laud the A&#347;vins well. Will they not listen to thy call? Will they not burn the Pa&#7751;is who are nearer them?</p><p>O Heroes, listen to the son of Vya&#347;va, and regard me here, Varu&#7751;a, Mitra, Aryaman, of one accord.</p><p>Devas whom we yearn for, of your gifts, of what ye bring to us, bestow By princes' hands on me, ye Mighty, day by day.</p><p>Him whom your offerings clothe, even as a woman with her robe, the A&#347;vins help to glory honouring him well.</p><p>Whoso regards your care of men as succour widest in its reach, About his dwelling go, ye A&#347;vins, loving us.</p><p>Come to us ye who pour down wealth, come to the home which men must guard: Like shafts, ye are made meet for offering by song.</p><p>Most fetching of all calls, the laud, as envoy. Heroes, called to you Be it your own, O A&#347;vin Pair.</p><p>Be ye in yonder sea of Heaven, or joying in the home of food, Listen to me, Immortal Ones.</p><p>This river with his lucid flow attracts you, more than all the streams,&#151; Even Sindhu with his path of gold.</p><p>O A&#347;vins, with that glorious fame come hither, through our brilliant song, Come ye whose ways are marked with light.</p><p>Harness the steeds who draw the car, O Vasu, bring the well-fed pair. O V&#257;yu, drink thou of our meath: come unto our water-offerings.</p><p>Wonderful V&#257;yu, Lord of Right, thou who art Tva&#7779;&#7789;ar's son-in-law, Thy saving succour we elect.</p><p>To Tva&#7779;&#7789;ar's son-in-law we pray for wealth whereof he hath control: For glory we seek vayu, men with juice effused.</p><p>From Heaven, auspicious V&#257;yu, come drive hither with thy noble steeds: Come on thy mighty car with wide-extending seat.</p><p>We call thee to the homes of men, thee wealthiest in noble food, and liberal as a press-stone with a horse's back.</p><p>So, glad and joyful in thine heart, do thou, Deva, V&#257;yu, first of all Vouchsafe us water, strength, and thought.</p>
