<p>IN ladle dropping oil your food goes in oblation up to Heaven, Goes to the Devas in search of bliss.</p><p>Agni I laud, the Sage inspired, crowner of offering through song, who listens and gives bounteous gifts.</p><p>O Agni, if we might obtain control of thee the potent Deva, then should we overcome our foes.</p><p>Kindled at offers he is Agni, hallower, meet for praise, with flame for hair: to him we seek.</p><p>Immortal Agni, shining far, enrobed with oil, well worshipped, bears The gifts of offering away.</p><p>The Monks with ladles lifted up, worshipping here with holy thought, have brought this Agni for our aid.</p><p>Immortal, Offerer, Deva, with wondrous power he leads the way, Urging the great assembly on.</p><p>Strong, he is set on deeds ofstrength. In offerings led in front, as Singer he completes the rite.</p><p>Excellent, he was made by thought. The Germ of beings have I gained, Yea, and die Sire of active strength.</p><p>Thee have I stablished, Excellent, O strengthened by the sage's prayer, thee, Agni, longing, nobly bright.</p><p>Agni, the swift and active One, singers, at time of offering, Eagerly kindle with their food.</p><p>Agni the Son of Strength who shines up to the Heaven in solemn rites, the wise of heart, I glorify.</p><p>Meet to be lauded and adored, showing in beauty through the dark, Agni, the Strong, is kindled well.</p><p>Agni is kindled as a bull, like a horsebearer of the Devas: Men with oblations worship him.</p><p>Thee will we kindle as a bull, we who are Bulls ourselves, O Bull.</p><p>Thee, Agni, shining mightily.</p>
