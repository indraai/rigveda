<div class="box hymn"><p>GIVE us wealth, Indra, that with might, as Heaven o’ertops the Earth, o’ercomes our foes in battle Wealth that brings thousands and that wins the corn-lands, wealth, Son of Strength! that vanquishes the foeman.</p><p>Even as the power of Devas, to thee, O Indra, all Devas sway was by the Devas entrusted, when thou, Impetuous! leagued with Indra, slewest Vṛtra the Dragon who enclosed the waters.</p><p>Indra, Strong, Victor, Mightier than the mighty, addressed with prayer and perfect in his splendour, Lord of the bolt that breaketh forts in pieces, became the King of the sweet juice of Soma..</p><p>There, Indra, while the light was won, the Paṇis f1ed, 'neath a hundred blows, for wise Dasoni, and greedy Śuṣṇa's magical devices nor left he any of their food remaining.</p><p>What time the thunder fell and Śuṣṇa perished, all life's support from the great Druh was taken.</p><p>Indra made room for his car-drivcr Kutsa who sate beside him, when he gained the sunlight.</p><p>As the Hawk rent for him the stalk that gladdens, he wrenched the head from Namuci the Dāsa. He guarded Nam, Sayya's son, in slumber, and sated him with food, success, and riches.</p><p>Thou, thunder-armed, with thy great might hast shattered Pipru's strong forts who knew the wiles of serpents. Thou gavest to thy worshipper Ṛjiśvan imperishable Wealth, O Bounteous Giver.</p><p>The crafty Vetasu, the swift Dasni, and Tugra speedily with all his servants, Hath Indra, gladdening with strong assistance, forced near as ’twere to glorify the Mother.</p><p>Resistless, with the hosts he battles, bearing in both his arms the Vṛtra-subduing thunder. He mounts his Bays, as the car-seat an archer: yoked at a word they bear the lofty Indra.</p><p>May we, O Indra, gain by thy new favour: so Parus laud thee, with their offers, that thou hast wrecked seven autumn forts, their shelter, slain Dāsa tribes and aided Purukutsa.</p><p>Favouring Uśanā the son of Kavi, thou wast his ancient strengthener, O Indra. Thou gavest Navavāstva. as a present, to the great father gavest back his grandson.</p><p>Thou, roaring Indra, drovest on the waters that made a roaring sound like rushing rivers, what time, O Hero, o’er the sea thou broughtest, in safety broughtest Turvaśa and Yadu.</p><p>This Indra, was thy work in war: thou sentest Dhuni and Cumuri to sleep and slumber. Dabhīti lit the flame for thee, and worshipped with fuel, hymns, poured Soma, dressed oblations.</p>
