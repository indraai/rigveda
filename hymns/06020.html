<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>GIVE us wealth, Indra, that with might, as Heaven o&#146;ertops the Earth, o&#146;ercomes our foes in battle Wealth that brings thousands and that wins the corn-lands, wealth, Son of Strength! that vanquishes the foeman.</p><p>Even as the power of Devas, to thee, O Indra, all Devas sway was by the Devas entrusted, when thou, Impetuous! leagued with Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, slewest V&#7771;tra the Dragon who enclosed the waters.</p><p>Indra, Strong, Victor, Mightier than the mighty, addressed with prayer and perfect in his splendour, Lord of the bolt that breaketh forts in pieces, became the King of the sweet juice of Soma..</p><p>There, Indra, while the light was won, the Pa&#7751;is f1ed, 'neath a hundred blows, for wise Dasoni, and greedy &#346;u&#7779;&#7751;a's magical devices nor left he any of their food remaining.</p><p>What time the thunder fell and &#346;u&#7779;&#7751;a perished, all life's support from the great Druh was taken.</p><p>Indra made room for his car-drivcr Kutsa who sate beside him, when he gained the sunlight.</p><p>As the Hawk rent for him the stalk that gladdens, he wrenched the head from Namuci the D&#257;sa. He guarded Nam, Sayya's son, in slumber, and sated him with food, success, and riches.</p><p>Thou, thunder-armed, with thy great might hast shattered Pipru's strong forts who knew the wiles of serpents. Thou gavest to thy worshipper &#7770;ji&#347;van imperishable Wealth, O Bounteous Giver.</p><p>The crafty Vetasu, the swift Dasni, and Tugra speedily with all his servants, Hath Indra, gladdening with strong assistance, forced near as &#146;twere to glorify the Mother.</p><p>Resistless, with the hosts he battles, bearing in both his arms the V&#7771;tra-subduing thunder. He mounts his Bays, as the car-seat an archer: yoked at a word they bear the lofty Indra.</p><p>May we, O Indra, gain by thy new favour: so Parus laud thee, with their offers, that thou hast wrecked seven autumn forts, their shelter, slain D&#257;sa tribes and aided Purukutsa.</p><p>Favouring U&#347;an&#257; the son of Kavi, thou wast his ancient strengthener, O Indra. Thou gavest Navav&#257;stva. as a present, to the great father gavest back his grandson.</p><p>Thou, roaring Indra, drovest on the waters that made a roaring sound like rushing rivers, What time, O Hero, o&#146;er the sea thou broughtest, in safety broughtest Turva&#347;a and Yadu.</p><p>This Indra, was thy work in war: thou sentest Dhuni and Cumuri to sleep and slumber. Dabh&#299;ti lit the flame for thee, and worshipped with fuel, hymns, poured Soma, dressed oblations.</p>
