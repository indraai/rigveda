<div class="box hymn"><p>DRINK, Indra, of the savoury juice, and cheer thee with our milky draught.</p><p>Be, for our weal, our Friend and sharer of the feast, and let thy wisdom guard us well.</p><p>In thy kind grace and favou. May we still be strong: expose us not to foe's attack. With manifold assistance guard and assist us, and bring us to felicity.</p><p>May these my songs of praise exalt thee, Lord, who hast abundant wealth. Men skilled in holy hymns, pure, with the hues of fire, have sung them with their lauds to thee.</p><p>He, with his might enhanced by Ṛṣis thousandfold, hath like an ocean spread himself. His majesty is praised as true at solemn rites, his power where holy singers rule.</p><p>Indra for worship of the Devas, Indra while offering proceeds, Indra, as worshippers in battle-shock, we call, Indra that we may win the spoil.</p><p>With might hath Indra spread out Heaven and Earth, with power hath Indra lighted up the Sun. In Indra are all creatures closely held; in him meet the distilling Soma-drops.</p><p>Men with their lauds are urging thee, Indra,  first. The Ṛbhus in accord have lifted up their voice, and Somas sung thee as the first.</p><p>Indra increased his manly strength at offering, in the wild rapture of this juice. And living men to-day, even as of old, sing forth their praises to his majesty.</p><p>I crave of thee that hero strength, that tho. Mayst first regard this prayer, Wherewith thou holpest Bhṛgu and the Yatis and Praskaṇva when the prize was staked.</p><p>Wherewith thou sentest mighty waters to the sea, that, Indra, is thy manly strength. For ever unattainable is this power of him to whom the worlds have cried aloud.</p><p>Help us, O Indra, when we pray to thee for wealth and hero might. First help thou on to strength the man who strives to win, and aid our laud, O Ancient One.</p><p>Help for us, Indra, as thou holpest Paura once, this man's devotions bent on gain. Help, as thou gavest Ruśama and Śyāvaka and Svarṇara and Kṛpa aid.</p><p>What newest of imploring prayers shall, then, the zealous mortal sing? For have not they who laud his might, and Indra-power won for themselves the light of Heaven?</p><p>When shall they keep the Law and praise thee mid the Devas? Who counts as Ṛṣi and as sage? When ever wilt thou, Indra Indra, come nigh to presser's or to praiser's call?</p><p>These songs of ours exceeding sweet, these hymns of praise ascend to thee, like ever-conquering chariots that display their strength, gain wealth, and give unfailing aid.</p><p>The Bhṛgus are like Suns, like Kaṇvas, and have gained all that their thoughts were bent upon. The living men 's race have sung exalting Indra with their lauds.</p><p>Best slayer of the Vṛtras, yoke thy Bay Steeds, Indra, from afar. Come with the High Ones hither, Indra, to us, Mighty,  juice.</p><p>For these, the bards and singers, have cried out to thee with prayer, to gain the offering. As such, O Indra, Indra, who lovest song, even as a lover bear my call.</p><p>Thou from the lofty plains above, O Indra, hurledst Vṛtra down. Thou dravest forth the kine of guileful Mṛgaya and Arbuda from the mountain's hold.</p><p>Bright were the flaming fires, the Sun gave forth his shine, and Soma, Indra's juice, shone clear. Indra, thou blewest the great Dragon from the air: men must regard that valorous deed.</p><p>The fairest courser of them all, who runneth on as ’twere to Heaven. Which Indra and the Devas gave, and Pākasthāman Kaurayāṇ.</p><p>To me hath Pākasthāman given, a ruddy horse, good at the pole, filling is girth and rousing wealth;</p><p>Compared with whom no other ten strong coursers, harnessed to the pole, bear Tugrya to his dwelling place.</p><p>Raiment is body, food is life, and healing ointment giveth strength. As the free-handed giver of the ruddy steed, I have named Pākasthāman fourth.</p>
