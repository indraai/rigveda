<h2>HYMN LVIII. Indra.</h2>

</section>
<main>
<div class="box hymn"><p>I SEND you forth the song of praise for Indu, hero-gladdener.</p><p>With hymn and plenty he invites you to complete the offering.</p><p>Thou wishest for thy kine a bull, for those who long for his approach, for those who turn away from him, lord of thy cows whom non. May kill.</p><p>The dappled kine who stream with milk prepare his draught of Soma juice: Clans in the birth-place of the Devas, in the three luminous realms of Heaven.</p><p>Praise, even as he is known, with song Indra the guardian of the kine, the Son of Truth, Lord of the brave.</p><p>Hither his Bay Steeds have been sent, red Steeds are on the sacred grass, Where we in concert sing our songs.</p><p>For Indra Thunder-armed the kine have yielded mingled milk and meath, what time he found them in the vault.</p><p>When I and Indra mount on high up to the Bright One's place and home, We, having drunk of meath, will reach his seat whose Friends are three times seven.</p><p>Sing, sing ye forth your songs of praise, ye Briyamedhas, sing your songs: Yea, let young children sing their lauds as a strong castle praise ye him.</p><p>Now loudly let the viol sound, the lute send out its voice with might, Shrill be, the music of the string. To Indra. is the hymn up-raised.</p><p>When hither speed the dappled cows, unflinching, easy to be milked, Seize quickly, as it bursts away, the Soma juice for Indra's drink.</p><p>Indra hath drunk, Agni hath drunk. all Deities have drunk their fill. Here Indra shall have his home, to whom the floods have sung aloud as mother-kine unto their calves.</p><p>Thou, Indra, to whom belong Seven Rivers, art a glorious Deva. The waters flow into thy throat as â€™twere a pipe with ample mouth.</p><p>He who hath made the fleet steeds spring, well-harnessed, to the worshipper. He, the swift Guide, is that fair form that loosed the horses near at hand.</p><p>Indra, the very Mighty, holds his enemies in utter scorn. He, far away, and yet a child, cleft the cloud smitten by his voice.</p><p>He, yet a boy exceeding small, mounted his newly-fashioned car. He for his Mother and his Sire cooked the wild mighty buffalo.</p><p>Lord of the home, fair-helmeted, ascend thy chariot wrought of gold. We will attend the Heavenly One, the thousand-footed, red of hue, matchless, who blesses where he goes.</p><p>With reverence they come hitherward to him as to. a Sovran lord, that the, may bring him near for this man's good success, to prosper and bestow his gifts.</p><p>The Priyamedhas have observed the offering of the men of old, Of ancient custom, while they strewed the sacred grass, and spread their sacred food.</p>
