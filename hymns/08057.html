<div class="box hymn"><p>EVEN as a car to give us aid, we draw thee hither for our bliss, Strong in thy deeds, checking assault, Lord, Mightiest Indra, of the brave!</p><p>Great in thy power and wisdom, Strong, with thought that comprehendeth all Thou hast filled full with majesty.</p><p>Thou very Mighty One, whose hands by virtue of thy greatness grasp, the golden bolt that breaks its way.</p><p>Your Lord of might that neâ€™er hath bent, that ruleth over all mankind, I call, that he, as he is wont. May aid the chariots and the men.</p><p>Whom, ever furthering, in frays that win the light, in both the hosts Men call to assist and to help.</p><p>Indra, the Strong, the measureless, worthy of praise, most Bountiful, Sole Ruler even over wealth.</p><p>Him, for his ample bounty, him, this Indra do I urge to drink, who, as his praise was sung of old, the Dancer, is the Lord of men.</p><p>Thou Mighty One, whose friendship none of mortals ever hath obtained None will attain unto thy might.</p><p>Aided by thee, with thee allied, in frays for water and for sun, Bolt-armed. May we win ample spoil.</p><p>So seek we thee with offering and songs, chief Lover of the Song, As, in our battles Indra, thou to Purumayya gavest help.</p><p>O Thunderer, thou whose friendship and whose onward guidance both are sweet, Thy offering must be prepared.</p><p>To us, ourselves, give ample room, give for our dwelling ample room Give ample room to us to live.</p><p>We count the banquet of the Devas a spacious pathway for the men, and for the cattle, and the car.</p><p>Six men, yea, two and two, made glad with Soma juice, come near to me With offerings pleasant to the taste.</p><p>Two brown-hued steeds, indrota's gift, two bays from Rksa's son were mine, From Asvamedha's son two red.</p><p>From Atithigva good car-steeds; from Arksa rein-obeying steeds, From Asvamedha beauteous ones.</p><p>Indrota, Atithigva's son, gave me six horses matched with mares And Patakratu gave besides.</p><p>Marked above all, amid the brown, is the red mare Vá¹›á¹£anvati, Obedient to the rein and whip.</p><p>O bound to me by deeds of might, not even the man who loves to blame.</p><p>Hath found a single fault in you.</p>
