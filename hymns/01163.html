<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>WHAT time, first springing into life, thou neighedst, proceeding from the sea or upper waters, Limbs of the deer hadst thou, and eagle pinions. O Steed, thy birth is nigh and must be lauded.</p><p>This Steed which Yama gave hath Trita harnessed, and him, the first of all, hath Indra mounted.</p><p>His bridle the Gandharva grasped. O Devas, from out the Sun ye fashioned forth the Courser.</p><p>Yama art thou, O Horse; thou art &#256;ditya; Trita art thou by secret operation. Thou art divided thoroughly from Soma. They say thou hast three bonds in Heaven that hold thee.</p><p>Three bonds, they say, thou hast in Heaven that bind thee, three in the waters, three within the ocean. To me thou seemest Varu&#7751;a, O Courser, there where they say is thy sublimest birth-place.</p><p>Here-, Courser, are the places where they groomed thee, here are the traces of thy hoofs as winner. Here have I seen the auspicious reins that guide thee, which those who guard the holy Law keep safely.</p><p>Thyself from far I recognized in spirit,&#151;a Bird that from below flew through the Heaven. I saw thy head still soaring, striving upward by paths unsoiled by dust, pleasant to travel.</p><p>Here I beheld thy form, matchless in glory, eager to win thee food at the Cow's station. Whene&#146;er a man brings thee to thine enjoyment, thou swallowest the plants most greedy eater.</p><p>After thee, Courser, come the car, the bridegroom, the kine come after, and the charm of maidens. Full companies have followed for thy friendship: the pattern of thy vigour Devas have copied.</p><p>Horns made of gold hath he: his feet are iron: less fleet than he, though swift as thought, is Indra. The Devas have come that the. May taste the oblation of him who mounted, first of all, the Courser.</p><p>Symmetrical in flank, with rounded haunches, mettled like heroes, the Celestial Coursers Put forth their strength, like swans in lengthened order, when they, the Steeds, have reached the heavenly causeway.</p><p>A body formed for flight hast thou, O Charger; swift as the wind in motion is thy spirit. Thy horns are spread abroad in all directions: they move with restless beat in wildernesses.</p><p>The strong Steed hath come forward to the slaughter, pondering with a mind directed God-ward. The goat who is his kin is led before him the sages and the singers follow after.</p><p>The Steed is come unto the noblest mansion, is come unto his Father and his Mother. This day shall he approach the Devas, most welcome: then he declares good gifts to him who offers.</p>
