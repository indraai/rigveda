<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>A THOUSAND heads hath Puru&#7779;a, a thousand eyes, a thousand feet.</p><p>On every side pervading Earth he fills a space ten fingers wide.</p><p>This Puru&#7779;a is all that yet hath been and all that is to be; The Lord of Immortality which waxes greater still by food.</p><p>So mighty is his greatness; yea, greater than this is Puru&#7779;a. All creatures are one-fourth of him, three-fourths eternal life in Heaven.</p><p>With three-fourths Puru&#7779;a went up: one-fourth of him again was here. Thence he strode out to every side over what cats not and what cats.</p><p>From him Vir&#257;j was born; again Puru&#7779;a from Vir&#257;j was born. As soon as he was born he spread eastward and westward o&#146;er the Earth.</p><p>When Devas prepared the offering with Puru&#7779;a as their offering, Its oil was spring, the holy gift was autumn; summer was the wood.</p><p>They balmed as victim on the grass Puru&#7779;a born in earliest time. With him the Deities and all S&#257;dhyas and &#7770;&#7779;is offered.</p><p>From that great general offering the dripping fat was gathered up. He formed the creatures of-the air, and animals both wild and tame.</p><p>From that great general offering &#7770;cas and S&#257;ma-hymns were born: Therefrom were spells and charms produced; the Yajus had its birth from it.</p><p>From it were horses born, from it all cattle with two rows of teeth: From it were generated kine, from it the goats and sheep were born.</p><p>When they divided Puru&#7779;a how many portions did they make? What do they call his mouth, his arms? What do they call his thighs and feet?</p><p>The Brahman was his mouth, of both his arms was the R&#257;janya made. His thighs became the Vai&#347;ya, from his feet the &#346;&#363;dra was produced.</p><p>The Moon was gendered from his mind, and from his eye the Sun had birth; Indra and Agni from his mouth were born, and V&#257;yu from his breath.</p><p>Forth from his navel came mid-air the sky was fashioned from his head Earth from his feet, and from his car the regions. Thus they formed the worlds.</p><p>Seven fencing-sticks had he, thrice seven layers of fuel were prepared, when the Devas, offering offering, bound, as their victim, Puru&#7779;a.</p><p>Devas, sacrificing, offered the victim these were the earliest holy ordinances. The Mighty Ones attained the height of Heaven, there where the S&#257;dhyas, Devas of old, are dwelling.</p>
