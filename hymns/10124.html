<div class="box hymn"><p>COME to this offering of ours, O Agni, threefold, with seven threads and five divisions.</p><p>Be our oblation-bearer and preceder: thou hast lain lon enough in during darkness.</p><p>I come a Deva foreseeing from the godless to immortality by secret pathways, While I, ungracious one, desert the gracious, leave mine own friends and seek the kin of strangers.</p><p>1, looking to the guest of other lineage, have founded many a rule of Law and Order. I bid farewell to the Great Deva, the Father, and, for neglect, obtain my share of worship.</p><p>I tarried many a year within this altar: I leave the Father, for my choice is Indra. Away pass Agni, Indra and Soma. Rule ever changes: this I come to favour.</p><p>These Devass have lost their powers of magic. But thou, O Indra, if thou dost love me, O King, discerning truth and right from falsehood, come and be Lord and Ruler of my kingdom.</p><p>Here is the light of Heaven, here allis lovely; here there is radiance, here is air's wide region. Let us two slaughter Vá¹›tra. Forth, O Soma! Thou art oblation: we therewith will serve thee.</p><p>The Sage hath fixed his form by wisdom in the heavens: Indra with no violence let the waters flow. Like women-folk, the floods that bring prosperity have eau lit his hue and colour as they gleamed and shone.</p><p>These wait upon his loftiest power and vigour: he dwells in these who triumph in their Godhead; And they, like people who elect their ruler, have in abhorrence turned away from Vá¹›tra.</p><p>They call him Swan, the abhorrent floods' Companion, moving in friendship with celestial Waters. The poets in their thought have looked on Indra swiftly approaching when Anustup calls him.</p>
