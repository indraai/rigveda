<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>Now let the mortal offer prayer to win the unexampled grace of these &#256;dityas and their aid to cherish life.</p><p>For not an enemy molests the paths which these &#256;dityas tread: Infallible guards, they strengthen us in happiness.</p><p>Now soo. May Bhaga, Indra, Varu&#7751;a, Mitra, Aryaman Give us the shelter widely spread which we implore.</p><p>With Devas come thou whose fostering care none checks, O Goddesss Aditi: Come, dear to many, with the Lords who guard us well.</p><p>For well these Sons of Aditi know to keep enmities aloof, Unrivalled, giving ample room, they save from woe.</p><p>Aditi guard our herd by day, Aditi, free from guile, by night, Aditi, ever strengthening, save us from grief!</p><p>And in the day our hymn is this: May Aditi come nigh to help, with loving-kindness bring us weal and chase our foes.</p><p>An. May the A&#347;vins, the divine Pair of Physicians, send us health: May they remove iniquity and chase our foes.</p><p>May Agni bless us with his fires, and S&#363;rya warm us pleasantly: May the pure Wind breathe sweet on us, and chase our foes.</p><p>Drive ye disease and strife away, drive ye away malignity: &#256;dityas, keep us ever far from sore distress.</p><p>Remove from us the arrow, keep famine, &#256;dityas! far away: Keep enmities afar from us, Lords of all wealth!</p><p>Now, O &#256;dityas, grant to us the shelter that lets man go free, Yea, even the sinner from his sin, ye Bounteous Devas 1</p><p>Whatever mortal with the powe r of demons fain would injure us, May he, impetuous, suffer harm by his own deeds.</p><p>May sin o&#146;ertake our human foe, the man who speaketh evil thing, him who would cause our misery, whose heart is false.</p><p>Devas, ye are with the simple ones, ye know each mortal in your hearts; Ye, Devas, well discriminate the false and true.</p><p>Fain would we have the sheltering aid of mountains and of water-floods: Keep far from us iniquity, O Heaven and Earth.</p><p>So with auspicious sheltering aid do ye, O Devas, carry us Beyond all trouble and distress, borne in your ship.</p><p>&#256;dityas, ye Most Mighty Ones, grant to our children and their seed Extended term of life that the, may live long days.</p><p>Offering, O &#256;dityas, is your inward monitor: be kind, for in the bond of kindred we are bound to you.</p><p>The Devas&#146; high protecting aid, the A&#347;vins, and the Deva who saves, Mitra and Varu&#7751;a for weal we supplicate.</p><p>Grant us a home with triple guard, Aryaman, Mitra, Varu&#7751;a! Unthreatened, Devas! meet for praise, and filled with men.</p><p>And as we human beings, O &#256;dityas, are akin to death, Graciously lengthen ye our lives that we may live.</p>
