<h1>HYMN CIII. Indra.</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>THAT highest Indra-power of thine is distant: that which is here sages possessed aforetime.</p><p>This one is on the Earth, in Heaven the other, and both unite as flag with flag in battle.</p><p>He spread the wide Earth out and firmly fixed it, smote with his thunderbolt and loosed the waters. Indra with his puissance struck down Ahi, rent Rauhiṇa to death and slaughtered Vyaṁsa.</p><p>Armed with his bolt and trusting in his prowess he wandered shattering the forts of Dāsas. Cast thy dart, knowing, Thunderer, at the Dasyu; increase the Ārya's might and glory, Indra.</p><p>For him who thus hath taught these human races, Indra, bearing a fame-worthy title, Thunderer, drawing nigh to subdue the Dasyus, hath given himself the name of Son for glory.</p><p>See this abundant wealth that he possesses, and put your trust in Indra's hero vigour. He found the cattle, and he found the horses, he found the plants, the forests and the waters.</p><p>To him the truly strong, whose deeds are many, to him the strong Bull let us pour the Soma. The Hero, watching like a thief in ambush, goes parting the possessions of the godless.</p><p>Well didst thou do that hero deed, O Indra, in waking with thy bolt the slumbering Ahi. in thee, delighted, Dames divine rejoiced them, the flying Devas and all Devas were joyful.</p><p>As thou hast smitten Śuṣṇa, Pipru, Vṛtra and Kuyava, and Śambara's forts<font size="-1" color="green">,</font> O Indra. This prayer of our. May Indra grant, and Mitra, and Aditi and Sindhu, Earth and Heaven.</p>
