<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>EXERTING all our strength with thoughts of power we glorify in speech Agni your dear familiar Friend, the darling Guest in every home.</p><p>Whom, served with sacrificial oil like Mitra, men presenting gifts Eulogize with their songs of praise</p><p>Much-lauded J&#257;tavedas, him who bears oblations up to Heaven Prepared in service of the Devas.</p><p>To noblest Agni, Friend of man, best V&#7771;tra-slayer, are we come, him in whose presence Rksa's son, mighty Srutarvan, waxes great;</p><p>To deathless J&#257;tavedas, meet for praise, adored, with sacred oil, Visible through the gloom of night</p><p>Even Agni whom these priestly men worship with sacrificial gifts, with lifted ladles offering them.</p><p>O Agni, this our newest hymn hath been addressed from us to thee, O cheerful Guest, well-born, most wise, worker of wonders, ne&#146;er deceived.</p><p>Agni. May it be dear to thee, most grateful, and exceeding sweet: Grow mightier, eulogized therewith.</p><p>Splendid with splendour. May it be, and in the battle with the foe Add loftier glory to thy fame.</p><p>Steed, cow, a lord of heroes, bright like Indra, who shall fill the car.</p><p>Whose high renown ye celebrate, and people praise each glorious deed.</p><p>Thou whom Gopavana made glad with song, O Agni A&#7749;giras, Hear this my call, thou Holy One.</p><p>Thou whom the priestly folk implore to aid the gathering of the spoil, Such be thou in the fight with foes.</p><p>I, called to him who reels with joy, Srutarvan, Rksa's son, shall stroke The heads of four presented steeds, like the long wool of fleecy rams.</p><p>Four coursers with a splendid car, Savistha's horses, fleet of foot, Shall bring me to the sacred feast, as flying steeds brought Tugra's son.</p><p>The very truth do I declare to thee, Paru&#7779;&#7751;&#299;, mighty flood. Waters! no man is there who gives more horses than Savistha gives.</p>
