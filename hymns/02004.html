<h2>HYMN IV Agni.</h2>

<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>FOR you I call the glorious refulgent Agni, the guest of men, rich in oblations Whom all must strive to win even as a lover, God among godly people, J&#257;tavedas.</p><p>Bh&#7771;gus who served him in the home of waters set him of old in houses of the living.</p><p>Over all worlds let Agni be the Sovran, the messenger of Devas with rapid coursers.</p><p>Among the tribes of men the Devas placed Agni as a dear Friend when they would dwell among them. Against the longing night. May he shine brightly, and show the offerer in the house his vigour.</p><p>Sweet is his growth as of one's own possessions; his look when rushing fain to burn is lovely. He darts his tongue forth, like a harnessed courser who shakes his flowing tail, among the bushes.</p><p>Since they who honour me have praised my greatness,&#151;he gave, as &#146;twere, his hue to those who love him. Known is he by his bright delightful splendour, and waxing old renews his youth forever.</p><p>Like one athirst, he lighteth up the forests; like water down the chariot ways he roareth. On his black path he shines in burning beauty, marked as it were the Heaven that smiles through vapour.</p><p>Around, consuming the broad Earth, he wanders, free roaming like an ox without a herdsman,&#151; Agni refulgent, burning up the bushes, with blackened lines, as though the Earth he seasoned.</p><p>I, in remembrance of thine ancient favour have sung my hymn in this our third assembly. O Agni, give us wealth with store of heroes and mighty strength in food and noble offspring.</p><p>May the G&#7771;tsamadas, serving in secret, through thee, O Agni, overcome their neighbours, Rich in good heroes and subduing foemen. That vital power give thou to chiefs and singers.</p>
