<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>FORT-RENDER, Lord of Wealth, dispelling foemen, Indra with lightnings hath o&#146;ercome the D&#257;sa.</p><p>Impelled by prayer and waxen great in body, he hath filled Earth and Heaven, the Bounteous Giver.</p><p>I stimulate thy zeal, the Strong, the Hero decking my song of praise forth; Immortal. O Indra, thou art equally the Leader of heavenly hosts and human generations.</p><p>Leading, his band Indra encompassed V&#7771;tra; weak grew the wily leader of enchanters. He who burns fierce in forests slaughtered Vya&#7745;sa, and made the Milch-kine of the nights apparent.</p><p>Indra, light-winner, days' Creator, conquered, victorious, hostile bands with those who loved him. For man the days' bright ensign he illumined, and found the light for his joy and gladness.</p><p>Forward to fiercely falling blows pressed Indra, herolike doing many hero exploits. These holy songs he taught the bard who gaised him, and widely spread these Dawns' resplendent colour.</p><p>They laud the mighty acts of him the Mighty, the many glorious deeds performed by Indra. He in his strength, with all-surpassing prowess, through wondrous arts crushed the malignant Dasyus.</p><p>Lord of the brave, Indra who rules the people gave freedom to the Devas by might and battle. Wise singers glorify with chanted praises these his achievements in Vivasv&#257;n's dwelling.</p><p>Excellent, Conqueror, the victory-giver, the winner of the light and Godlike Waters, He who hath won this broad Earth and this Heaven, -in Indra they rejoice who love devotions.</p><p>He gained possession of the Sun and Horses, Indra obtained the Cow who feedeth many. Treasure of gold he won; he smote the Dasyus, and gave protection to the &#256;ryan colour.</p><p>He took the plants and days for his possession; he gained the forest trees and air's mid-region. Vala he cleft, and chased away opponents: thus was he tamer of the overweening.</p><p>Call we on Indra, auspicious Indra, best Hero in the fight where spoil is gathered, the Strong, who listens, who gives aid in battles, who subdues the V&#7771;tras, wins and gathers treasures.</p>
