<h2>HYMN LXXVI. Indu.</h2>

<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>ON flows the potent juice, sustainer of the heavens, the strength of Devas, whom men must hail with shouts of joy.</p><p>The Gold-hued, started like a courser by brave men, impetuously winneth splendour in the streams.</p><p>He takes his weapons, like a hero, in his hands, fain to win light, car-borne, in forays for the kine. Indu, while stimulating India's might, is urged forward and balmed by sages skilful in their task.</p><p>Soma, as thou art purified with flowing wave, exhibiting thy strength enter thou Indra's throat. Make both worlds stream for us, as lightning doth the clouds: mete out exhaustless powers for us, as &#146;twere through song.</p><p>Onward he flows, the King of all that sees the light: the &#7770;&#7779;is&#146; Lord hath raised the song of offering; Even he who is adorned with S&#363;rya's arrowy beam, Father of hymns, whose wisdom is beyond our reach.</p><p>Like as a bull to herds, thou flowest to the pail, bellowing as a steer upon the water's lap. So, best of Cheerers, thou for Indra flowest on that we, with thy protection. May o&#146;ercome in fight.</p>
