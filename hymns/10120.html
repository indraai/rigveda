<div class="box hymn"><p>IN all the worlds That was the Best and Highest whence sprang the Mighty Devas, of splendid valour.</p><p>As soon as born he overcomes his foemen, be in whom all who lend him aid are joyful.</p><p>Grown mighty in his strength, with ample vigour, he as a foe strikes fear into the Dāsa, Eager to win the breathing and the breathless. All sang thy praise at banquet and oblation.</p><p>All concentrate on thee their mental vigour, what time these, twice or thrice, are thine assistants. Blend what is sweeter than the sweet with sweetness: win. quickly with our meath that meath in battle.</p><p>Therefore in thee too, thou who winnest riches, at every banquet are the sages joyful. With mightier power, Bold Deva, extend thy firmness: let not malignant Yātudhānas harm thee.</p><p>Proudly we put our trust in thee in battles, when we behold great wealth the prize of combat. I with my words impel thy weapons onward, and sharpen with my meditation thy vital vigour.</p><p>Worthy of praises, many-shaped, most skilful, most energetic, Āptya of the Aptyas: He with his might destroys the seven Danus, subduing many who were deemed his equals.</p><p>Thou in that house which thy protection guardeth bestowest wealth, the higher and the lower. Thou stablishest the two much-wandering Mothers, and bringest many deeds to their completion.</p><p>Brhaddiva, the foremost of light-winners, repeats these holy prayers, this strength of Indra. He rules the great self-luminous fold of cattle, and all the doors of light hath he thrown open.</p><p>Thus hath Brhaddiva, the great Atharvan, spoken to Indra as himself in person. The spotless Sisters, they who are his Mothers, with power exalt him and impel him onward.</p>
