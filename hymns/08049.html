<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>AGNI, come hither with thy fires; we choose thee as Invoking Monk.</p><p>Let the extended ladle full of oil balm thee, best Monk, to sit on sacred grass.</p><p>For unto thee, O A&#7749;giras, O Son of Strength, move ladles in the offering. To Agni, Child of Force, whose locks drop oil, we seek, foremost in sacrificial rites.</p><p>Agni, thou art Disposer, Sage, Herald, bright God! and worshipful, best offerer, cheerful, to be praised in holy rites, pure Lord! by singers with their hymns.</p><p>Most Youthful and Eternal, bring the longing Devas to me, the guileless, for the feast. Come, Vasu, to the banquet that is well-prepared: rejoice thee, gracious, with our songs.</p><p>Famed art thou, Agni, far and wide, Preserver, righteous, and a Sage. The holy singers, O refulgent kindled God! arrangers, call on thee to come.</p><p>Shine, most Resplendent! blaze, send bliss unto the folk, and to thy worshipper Great art thou. May my princes, with good fires, subduing foes, rest in the keeping of the Devas.</p><p>O Agni, as thou burnest down to Earth even high-grown underwood, So, bright as Mitra is, burn him who injures us, him who plots ill against thy friend.</p><p>Give us not as a prey to mortal enemy, nor to the wicked friend of fiends. With conquering guards, auspicious, unassailable, protect us, O Most Youthful God.</p><p>Protect us, Agni, through the first, protect us through the second hymn, Protect us through three hymns, O Lord of Power and Might, through four hymns, Vasu, guard thou us.</p><p>Preserve us from each fiend who brings the Devas no gift, preserve thou us in deeds of strength: For we possess in thee the nearest Friend of all, for service of the Devas and weal.</p><p>O Holy Agni, give us wealth renowned with men and strengthening life. Bestow on us, O Helper, that which many crave, more glorious still by righteousness;</p><p>Wherewith we may o&#146;ercome our rivals in the war, o&#146;erpowering the foe's designs. So wax thou by our food, O Excellent in strength. Quicken our thoughts that find out wealth.</p><p>Agni is even as a bull who whets and brandishes his horns. Well-sharpened are his jaws whic. May not be withstood: the Child of Strength hath powerful teeth.</p><p>Not to be stayed, O Bull, O Agni, are thy teeth when thou art spreading far and wide. Make our oblations duly offered up, O Monk, and give us store of precious things.</p><p>Thou liest in the wood: from both thy Mothers mortals kindle thee. Unweariedly thou bearest up the offerer's gifts, then shinest bright among the Devas.</p><p>And so the seven monks, O Agni, worship thee, free-giver, Everlasting One. Thou cleavest through the rock with heat and fervent glow. Agni, rise up above the men.</p><p>For you let us whose grass is trimmed call Agni, Agni, restless God. Let us whose food is offered call to all the tribes Agni the Invoking Monk of men.</p><p>Agni, with noble psalm that tells his wish he dwells, thinking on thee who guardest him. Speedily bring us strength of many varied sorts to be most near to succour us.</p><p>Agni, Praise-singer! Lord of men, God burner-up of R&#257;k&#7779;asas, Mighty art thou, the ever-present Household-Lord, Home-friend and Guardian from the sky.</p><p>Let no fiend come among us, O thou rich in light, no spell of those who deal in spells. To distant pastures drive faint hunger: far away, O Agni, chase the demons&#146; friends.</p>
