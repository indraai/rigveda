<h1>HYMN XX. Ṛbhus.</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>FOR the Celestial Race this song of praise which gives wealth lavishly.</p><p>They who for Indra, with their mind, formed horses harnessed by a word, attained by works of offering.</p><p>They for the two Nāsatyas wrought a light car moving every way: They formed a nectar-yielding cow.</p><p>The Ṛbhus with effectual prayers, honest, with constant labour, made Their Sire and Mother young again.</p><p>Together came your gladdening drops with Indra by the Devas girt, with the Kings.</p><p>The ceremonial ladle, wrought newly by the Deva Tvaṣṭar's hand— Four ladles have ye made thereof.</p><p>Vouchsafe us wealth, to him who pours thrice seven libations, yea, to each Give wealth, pleased with our eulogies.</p><p>By pious acts they won themselves, a share in offerings with Devas.</p>
