<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>LIKE birds who keep their watch, plashing in water, like the loud voices of the thundering rain-cloud, like merry streamlets bursting from the mountain, thus to B&#7771;haspati our hymns have sounded.</p><p>The Son of A&#7749;girases, meeting the cattle, as Bhaga, brought in Aryaman among us.</p><p>As Friend of men he decks the wife and husband: as for the race, nerve our coursers.</p><p>B&#7771;haspati, having won them from the mountains, strewed down, like barley out of winnowing- baskets, the vigorous, wandering cows who aid the pious, desired of all, of blameless form, well-coloured.</p><p>As the Sun dews with meath the seat of Order, and casts a flaming meteor down from Heaven. So from the rock B&#7771;haspati forced the cattle, and cleft the Earth's skin as it were with water.</p><p>Forth from mid air with light he dravc the darkness, as the gale blows a lily from the fiver. Like the wind grasping at the cloud of Vala, B&#7771;haspati gathered to himself the cattle,</p><p>B&#7771;haspati, when he with fiery lightnings cleft through the weapon of reviling Vala, Consumed&#7717;im as tongues cat what teeth have compassed: he threw the prisons of the red cows open.</p><p>That secret name borne by the lowing cattle within the cave B&#7771;haspati discovered, and drave, himself, the bright kine from the mountain, like a bird's young after the egg's disclosure.</p><p>He looked around on rock-imprisoned sweetness as one who eyes a fish in scanty water. B&#7771;haspati, cleaving through with varied clamour, brought it forth like a bowl from out the timber.</p><p>He found the light of Heaven, and fire, and Morning: with lucid rays he forced apart the darkness. As from a joint, B&#7771;haspati took the marrow of Vala as he gloried in his cattle.</p><p>As trees for foliage robbed by winter, Vala mourned for the cows B&#7771;haspati had taken. He did a deed ne&#146;er done, ne&#146;er to be equalled, whereby the Sun and Moon ascend alternate.</p><p>Like a dark steed adorned with pearl, the Fathers have decorated Heaven With constellations. They set the light in day, in night the darkness. B&#7771;haspati cleft the rock and found the cattle.</p><p>This homage have we.offered to the Cloud Deva who thunders out to many in succession. May this B&#7771;haspati vouchsafe us fulness of life with kine and horses, men, and heroes.</p>
