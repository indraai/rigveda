<p>MEN have abstained from pouring juice they count not Indra as a God.</p><p>Where at the votary's store my friend Vrsakapi hath drunk his fill. Supreme is Indra over all.</p><p>Thou, Indra, heedless passest by the ill Vrsakapi hath wrought; Yet nowhere else thou findest place wherein  juice. Supreme is Indra over all.</p><p>What hath he done to injure thee, this tawny beast Vrsakapi, with whom thou art so angry now? What is the votary's foodful store? Supreme is Indra over all.</p><p>Soo. May the hound who hunts the boar seize him and bite him in the car, O Indra, that Vrsakapi whom thou protectest as a friend, Supreme is Indra over all.</p><p>Kapi hath marred the beauteous things, all deftly wrought, that were my joy. In pieces will I rend his head; the sinner's portion sball be woo. Supreme is Indra over all.</p><p>No Dame hath ampler charms than 1, or greater wealth of love's delights. None with more ardour offers all her beauty to her lord's embrace. Supreme is Indra over all.</p><p>Mother whose love is quickly wibn, I say what verily will be. My,breast, O Mother, and my head and both my hips seem quivering. Supreme is Indra over all.</p><p>Dame with the lovely hands and arms, with broad hair-plaits add ample hips, Why, O thou Hero's wife, art thou angry with our Vrsakapi? Supreme is Indra over all.</p><p>This noxious creature looks on me as one bereft of hero's love, Yet Heroes for my sons have I, the Devas&#146; Friend and Indra's Queen. Supreme is Indra over all.</p><p>From olden time the matron goes to feast and general offering. Mother of Heroes, Indra's Queen, the rite's ordainer is extolled. Supreme is Indra over all.</p><p>So have I heard Indr&#257;&#7751;&#299; called most fortunate among these Dames, for never shall her Consort die in future time through length of days. Supreme is Indra overall.</p><p>Never, Indralni, have I joyed without my friend Vrsakapi, whose welcome offering here, made pure with water, goeth to the Devas. Supreme is Indra over all.</p><p>Wealthy Vrsakapayi, blest with sons and consorts of thy sons, Indra will eat thy bulls, thy dear oblation that effecteth much. Supreme is Indra over all.</p><p>Fifteen in number, then, for me a score of bullocks they prepare, and I devour the fat thereof: they fill my belly full with food. Supreme is Indra over all.</p><p>Like as a bull with pointed horn, loud bellowing amid the herds, Sweet to thine heart, O Indra, is the brew which she who tends thee pours. Supreme is Indra over all.</p><p>O Indra this Vrsakapi hath found a slain wild animal, Dresser, and new-made pan, and knife, and wagon with a load of wood. Supreme is Indra over all.</p><p>Distinguishing the D&#257;sa and the &#256;rya, viewing all, I go. I look upon the wise, and drink the simple votary's Soma juice. Supreme is Indra over all.</p><p>The desert plains and steep descents, how many leagues in length they spread! Go to the nearest houses, go unto thine home, Vrsakapi. Supreme is Indra over all.</p><p>Turn thee again Vrsakapi: we twain will bring thee happiness. Thou goest homeward on thy way along this path which leads to sleep. Supreme is Indra over all.</p><p>When, Indra and Vrsakapi, ye travelled upward to your home, Where was that noisome beast, to whom went it, the beast that troubles man? Supreme is Indra over all.</p><p>Daughter of Manu, Parsu bare a score of children at a birth. Her portion verily was bliss although her burthen caused her grief.</p>
