<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>WITH all the succours that are yours, O A&#347;vins, hither come to us: Wonderful, borne on paths of gold, drink ye the meath with Soma juice.</p><p>Come now, ye A&#347;vins, on your car decked with a sun-bright canopy, Bountiful, with your golden forms, Sages with depth of intellect.</p><p>Come hither from the Nahusas, come, drawn by pure hymns, from mid-air.</p><p>O A&#347;vins, drink the savoury juice shed in the Ka&#7751;vas' offering.</p><p>Come to us hither from the heavens, come from mid-air, well-loved by us: Here Ka&#7751;va's son hath pressed for you the pleasant meath of Soma juice.</p><p>Come, A&#347;vins, to give car to us, , A&#347;vins, come. Hail, Strengtheners of the praise-song speed onward, ye Heroes, with your thoughts.</p><p>As, Heroes, in the olden time the &#7770;&#7779;is called you to their aid, So now, O A&#347;vins, come to us, come near to this mine eulogy.</p><p>Even from the luminous sphere of Heaven come to us, ye who find the light, Carers for Vatsa, through our meditations and lauds, O yewho hearour call.</p><p>Do others more than we adore the A&#347;vins with their hymns of praise? The &#7770;&#7779;i Vatsa, Ka&#7751;va's son, hath magnified you with his songs.</p><p>The holy singer with his hymns hath called you, A&#347;vins, hither-ward; Best V&#7771;tra-slayers, free from stain, as such bring us felicity.</p><p>What time, ye Lords of ample wealth, the Lady mounted on your car, then, O ye A&#347;vins, ye attained all wishes that your hearts desired.</p><p>Come thence, O A&#347;vins, on your car that hath a thousand ornaments: Vatsa the sage, the sage's son, hath sung a song of sweets to you.</p><p>Cheerers of many, rich in goods, discoverers of opulence, the A&#347;vins, Riders through the sky, have welcomed this my song of praise.</p><p>O A&#347;vins, grant us all rich gifts wherewith no man mav interfere. Make us observe the stated times: give us not over to reproach.</p><p>Whether, N&#257;satyas, ye be nigh, or whether ye be far away, Come thence, O A&#347;vins, on your car that hath a thousand ornaments.</p><p>Vatsa the &#7770;&#7779;i with his songs, N&#257;satyas, hath exalted you: Grant him rich food distilling oil, graced with a thousand ornaments.</p><p>Bestow on him, O A&#347;vins, food that strengthens, and that drops with oil, On him who praises you for bliss, and, Lords of bounty, prays for wealth.</p><p>Come to us, ye who subdue the foe, Lords of rich treasure, to this hymn. O Heroes, give us high renown and these good things of Earth for help.</p><p>The Priyamedhas have invoked you with all succours that are yours, You, A&#347;vins, Lords of solemn rites, with calls entreating you to come.</p><p>Come to us, A&#347;vins, ye Who bring felicity, auspicious Ones, to Vatsa who with prayer and hymn, lovers of song, hath honoured you.</p><p>Aid us, O Heroes, for those hymns for which ye helped GoSarya erst, Gave Va&#347;a, Dasavraja aid, and Ka&#7751;va and Medhatithi:</p><p>And favoured Trasadasyu, ye Heroes, in spoil-deciding fray: For these, O A&#347;vins, graciously assist us in acquiring strength.</p><p>O A&#347;vins. May pure hymns of ours, and songs and praises, honour you: Best slayers everywhere of foes, as such we fondly yearn for you.</p><p>Three places of the A&#347;vins, erst concealed, are made apparent now. Both Sages, with the flight of Law come hither unto those who live.</p>
