<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>WITH all the assists that are yours, O Indra, hither come to us: Wonderful, borne on paths of gold, drink ye the meath with Soma juice.</p><p>Come now, ye Indra, on your car decked with a sun-bright canopy, Bountiful, with your golden forms, Sages with depth of intellect.</p><p>Come hither from the Nahusas, come, drawn by pure hymns, from mid-air.</p><p>O Indra, drink the savoury juice shed in the Ka·πávas' offering.</p><p>Come to us hither from the heavens, come from mid-air, well-loved by us: Here Ka·πáva's son hath pressed for you the pleasant meath of Soma juice.</p><p>Come, Indra, to give car to us, Indra, come. Hail, Strengtheners of the praise-song speed onward, ye Heroes, with your thoughts.</p><p>As. Heroes, in the olden time the ·πö·π£is called you to their aid, So now, O Indra, come to us, come near to this mine eulogy.</p><p>Even from the luminous sphere of Heaven come to us, ye who find the light, Carers for Vatsa, through our meditations, and lauds, O yewho hearour call.</p><p>Do others more than we adore the Indra with their hymns of praise? The ·πö·π£i Vatsa, Ka·πáva's son, hath magnified you with his songs.</p><p>The holy singer with his hymns hath called you, Indra, hither-ward; Best V·πõtra-slayers, free from stain, as such bring us felicity.</p><p>What time, ye Lords of ample wealth, the Lady mounted on your car, then, O ye Indra, ye attained all wishes that your hearts desired.</p><p>Come thence, O Indra, on your car that hath a thousand ornaments: Vatsa the sage, the sage's son, hath sung a song of sweets to you.</p><p>Cheerers of many, rich in goods, discoverers of opulence, the Indra, Riders through the sky, have welcomed this my song of praise.</p><p>O Indra, grant us all rich gifts wherewith no man mav interfere. Make us observe the stated times: give us not over to reproach.</p><p>Whether, NƒÅsatyas, ye be nigh, or whether ye be far away, Come thence, O Indra, on your car that hath a thousand ornaments.</p><p>Vatsa the ·πö·π£i with his songs, NƒÅsatyas, hath exalted you: Grant him rich food distilling oil, graced with a thousand ornaments.</p><p>Bestow on him, O Indra, food that strengthens, and that drops with oil, On him who praises you for bliss, and, Lords of bounty, prays for wealth.</p><p>Come to us, ye who subdue the foe, Lords of rich treasure, to this hymn. O Heroes, give us high renown and these good things of Earth for help.</p><p>The Priyamedhas have invoked you with all assists that are yours, You, Indra, Lords of solemn rites, with calls entreating you to come.</p><p>Come to us, Indra, ye Who bring felicity, auspicious Ones, to Vatsa who with prayer and hymn, lovers of song, hath honoured you.</p><p>Aid us, O Heroes, for those hymns for which ye helped GoSarya erst, Gave Va≈õa, Dasavraja aid, and Ka·πáva and Medhatithi:</p><p>And favoured Trasadasyu, ye Heroes, in spoil-deciding fray: For these, O Indra, graciously assist us in acquiring strength.</p><p>O Indra, may pure hymns of ours, and songs and praises, honour you: Best slayers everywhere of foes, as such we fondly yearn for you.</p><p>Three places of the Indra, erst concealed, are made apparent now. Both Sages, with the flight of Law come hither unto those who live.</p>
