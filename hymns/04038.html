<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>FROM you two came the gifts in days aforetime which Trasadasyu granted to the P&#363;rus.</p><p>Ye gave the winner of our fields and plough-lands, and the strong smiter who subdued the Dasyus.</p><p>And ye gave mighty Dadhikr&#257;s, the giver of many gifts, who visiteth all people, Impetuous hawk, swift and of varied colour, like a brave King whom each true man must honour.</p><p>Whom, as &#146;twere down a precipice, swift rushing, each P&#363;ru praises and his heart rejoices,&#151; Springing forth like a hero fain for battle, whirling the car and flying like the tempest.</p><p>Who gaineth precious booty in the combats and moveth, winning spoil, among the cattle; Shown in bright colour, looking on the assemblies, beyond the churl, to worship of the living.</p><p>Loudly the folk cry after him in battles, as &#146;twere a thief who steals away a garment; Speeding to glory, or a herd of cattle, even as a hungry falcon swooping downward.</p><p>And, fain to come forth first amid these armies, this way and that with rows of cars he rushes, Gay like a bridesman, making him a garland, tossing the dust, champing the rein that holds him.</p><p>And that strong Steed, victorious and faithful, obedient with his body in the combat, Speeding straight on amid the swiftly pressing, casts o&#146;er his brows the dust he tosses upward.</p><p>And at his thunder, like the roar of Heaven, those who attack tremble and are affrighted; For when he fights against embattled thousands, dread is he in his striving; non. May stay him.</p><p>The people praise the overpowering swiftness of this fleet Steed who giveth men abundance. Of him they say when drawing back from battle. Dadhikr&#257;s hath sped forward with his thousands.</p><p>Dadhikr&#257;s hath o&#146;erspread the Fivefold People with vigour, as the Sun lightens the waters. May the strong Steed who winneth hundreds, thousands, requite with sweetness these my words and praises.</p>
