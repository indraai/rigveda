<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>THUS in the Soma, in wild joy the Brahman hath exalted thee: Thou, mightiest thunder-armed, hast driven by force the Dragon from the Earth, lauding thine own imperial sway.</p><p>The mighty flowing Soma-draught, brought by the Hawk, hath gladdened thee, that in thy strength, O Thunderer, thou hast struck down V&#7771;tra from the floods, lauding thine own imperial sway.</p><p>Go forward, meet the foe, be bold; thy bolt of thunder is not checked.</p><p>Manliness, Indra, is thy might: stay V&#7771;tra, make the waters thine, lauding thine own imperial sway.</p><p>Thou smotest V&#7771;tra from the Earth, smotest him, Indra, from the sky. Let these life-fostering waters flow attended by the Marut host, lauding thine own imperial sway.</p><p>The wrathful Indra with his bolt of thunder rushing on the foe, Smote fierce on trembling V&#7771;tra's back, and loosed the waters free to run, lauding his own imperial sway.</p><p>With hundred-jointed thunderbolt Indra hath struck him on the back, and, while rejoicing in the juice, seeketh prosperity for friends, lauding his own imperial sway.</p><p>Indra, unconquered might is thine, Thunderer, Caster of the Stone; For thou with thy surpassing power smotest to death the guileful beast, lauding thine own imperial sway.</p><p>Far over ninety spacious floods thy thunderbolts were cast abroad: Great, Indra, is thy hero might, and strength is seated in thine arms, lauding thine own imperial sway.</p><p>Laud him a thousand all at once, shout twenty forth the hymn of praise. Hundreds have sung aloud to him, to Indra hath the prayer been raised, lauding his own imperial sway.</p><p>Indra hath smitten down the power of V&#7771;tra,&#151;might with stronger might. This was his manly exploit, he slew V&#7771;tra and let loose the floods, lauding his own imperial sway.</p><p>Yea, even this great Pair of Worlds trembled in terror at thy wrath, when, Indra, Thunderer, Marut-girt, thou slewest V&#7771;tra in thy strength, lauding thine own imperial sway.</p><p>But V&#7771;tra scared not Indra with his shaking or his thunder roar. On him that iron thunderbolt fell fiercely with its thousand points, lauding his own imperial sway.</p><p>When with the thunder thou didst make thy dart and V&#7771;tra meet in war, Thy might, O Indra, fain to subdue the Dragon, was set firm in Heaven, lauding thine own imperial sway.</p><p>When at thy shout, O Thunder-armed, each thing both fixed and moving shook, E&#146;en Tva&#7779;&#7789;ar trembled at thy wrath and quaked with fear because of thee, lauding thine own imperial sway.</p><p>There is not, in our knowledge, one who passeth Indra in his strength: In him the Deities have stored manliness, insight, power and might, lauding his own imperial sway.</p><p>Still as of old, whatever rite Atharvan, Manus sire of all, Dadhyach performed, their prayer and praise united in that Indra meet, lauding his own imperial sway.</p>
