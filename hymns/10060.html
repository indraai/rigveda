<h1>RigVeda Hymn 10060</h1>

<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>BRINGING our homage we have come to one magnificent in look.</p><p>Glorified of the mighty Devas</p><p>To Asamati, spring of gifts, lord of the brave, a radiant car, the conqueror of Bhajeratha</p><p>Who, when the spear hath armed his hand, or even weaponless o&#146;erthrows Men strong as buffaloes in fight;</p><p>Him in whose service flourishes Iksvaku, rich and dazzling-bright. As the Five Tribes that are in Heaven.</p><p>Indra, support the princely power of Rathaprosthas matched by none, Even as the Sun for all to see.</p><p>Thou for Agastya's sister's sons yokest thy pair of ruddy steeds. Thou troddest niggards under foot, all those, O King, who brought no gifts.</p><p>This is the mother, this the sire, this one hath come to be thy life. What brings thee forth is even this. Now come, Subandhu, get thee forth.</p><p>As with the leather thong they bind the chariot yoke to hold it fast, So have I held thy spirit fast, held it for life and not for death, held it for thy security.</p><p>Even as this Earth, the mighty Earth, holds fast the monarchs of the wood. So have I held thy spirit fast, held it for life and not for death, held it for thy security.</p><p>Subandlin's spirit I have brought from Yarna, from Vivasv&#257;n's Son, Brought it for life and not for death, yea, brought it for security.</p><p>The wind blows downward from on high, downward the Sun-God sends his heat, Downward the milch-cow pours her milk: so downward go thy pain and grief.</p><p>Felicitous is this mine hand, yet more felicitous is this. This hand contains all healing balms, and this makes whole with gentle touch.</p>
