<h1>HYMN XLVIII. Indra Vaikuntha.</h1>
<p>I WAS the first possessor of all precious gear: the wealth of every man I win and gather up.</p>

<p>I WAS the first possessor of all precious gear: the wealth of every man I win and gather up.</p><p>On me as on a Father living creatures call; I deal enjoyment to tho. man who offers gifts.</p><p>I, Indra, am Atharvan's stay and firm support: I brought forth kine to Trita from the Dragon's grasp. I stripped the Dasyus of their manly might, and gave the cattle-stalls to Matarigvan and Dadhyac.</p><p>For me hath Tva&#7779;&#7789;ar forged the iron thunderbolt: in me the Devas have centred intellectual power. My sheen is like the Sun's insufferably bright: men honour me as Lord for past and future deeds.</p><p>I won myself these herdi of cattle, steeds and kine, and gold in ample store, with my destructive bolt. I give full many a thousand to the worshipper, what time the Somas and the lauds have made me glad.</p><p>Indra am I non ever wins my wealth from me never at any time am I a thrall to death. Pressing the Soma, ask riches from me alone: ye, P&#363;rus, in my friendship shall not suffer harm.</p><p>These, breathing loud in fury, two and two, who caused Indra to bring his bolt of thunder to the fray, the challengers, I struck with deadly weapon down: firm stand what words the Deva speaks to his worshippers. This One by stronger might I conquered singly; yea, also two: shall three prevail against me? Like many sheaves upon the floor I thrash them. How can my foes, the Indraless, revile me?</p><p>Against the Gungus I made Atithigva strong, and kept him mid the folk like V&#7771;tra-conquering strength, when I won glory in the great foe-subduing fight, in battle where Karanja fell, and Par&#7751;aya.</p><p>With food for mine enjoyment Sapya Nami came: he joined me as a friend of old in search of kine. As I bestowed on him an arrow for the fight I made him worthy of the song apd hymn of praise.</p><p>One of the two hath Soma, seen within it; the Herdsman with the bone shows forth the other. He, fain to fight the Bull whose horns were sharpened, stood fettered in the demon's ample region.</p><p>I ne&#146;er violate the statutes of Devas, of Devas, Rudriyas, &#256;dityas. These Devas have formed me for auspicious vigour, unconquered and invincible forever.</p>
