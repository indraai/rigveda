<div class="box hymn"><p>THAT which is wealthiest, Wealthy Deva in splendoursmost illustrious, Soma is pressed: thy gladdening draught, Indra! libation's Lord! is this.</p><p>Effectual, most Effectual One! thine, as bestowing wealth of hymns, Soma is pressed: thy gladdening draught, Indra! libation's Lord! is this.</p><p>Wherewith thou art increased in strength, and conquerest with thy proper aids, Soma is pressed: thy gladdening draught, Indra! libation's Lord! is this.</p><p>Him for your sake I glorify as Lord of Strength who wrongeth none, the Hero Indra, conquering all, most Bounteous, Deva of all the tribes.</p><p>Those Goddesses, both Heaven and Earth, revere the power and might of him, him whom our songs increase in strength, the Lord of bounty swift to come.</p><p>To seat your Indra, I will spread abroad with power this song of praise.</p><p>The saving assists that abide in him, like songs, extend and grow.</p><p>A recent Friend, he found the skilful priest: he drank, and showed forth treasure from the Devas. He conquered, borne by strong all-shaking mares, and was with far-spread power his friends' Protector.</p><p>In course of Law the sapient juice was quaffed: the Deities to glory turned their mind. Winning through hymns a lofty title, he, the Lovely, made his beauteous form apparent.</p><p>Bestow on us the most illustrious strength ward off men's manifold malignities. Give with thy might abundant vital force, and aid us graciously in gaining riches.</p><p>We turn to thee as Giver, liberal Indra. Lord of the Bay Steeds, be not thou ungracious. No friend among mankind have we to lookto: why have men called thee him who spurs the niggard?</p><p>Give us not up, Strong Hero! to the hungry: unharmed be we whom thou, so rich, befriendest. Full many a boon hast thou for men demolish those who present no gifts nor pour oblations.</p><p>As Indra thundering impels the rain-clouds, so doth he send us store of kine and horses. Thou art of old the Cherisher of singers let not the rich who bring no gifts deceive thee.</p><p>Adbyaryu, hero, bring to mighty Indrafor he is King thereof-the pressed-out juices; To him exalted by the hymns and praises, ancient and modern, of the singing á¹šá¹£is.</p><p>In the wild joy of this hath Indra, knowing full many a form, struck down resistless Vá¹›tras. Proclaim aloud to him the savoury Soma so that the Hero, strong of jawe may drink it.</p><p>May Indra drink this Soma poured to please him, and cheered therewith subdue Vá¹›tra with his thunder. Come to our offering even from a distance, good lover of our songs, the bard's Supporter.</p><p>The cup whence Indra drinks the draught is present: the Amá¹›ta dear to Indra hath been drunken, that he may cheer the Deva to gracious favour, and keep far from us hatred and affliction.</p><p>Therewith enraptured. Hero, subdue our foemen, the unfriendly, Indra be they kin or strangers, Those who still aim their hostile darts to smite us, turn them to flight, O Indra, crush and kill them.</p><p>O Indra Indra, in these our battles win easy paths for us and ample freedom. That we may gain waters and seed and offspring, set thou our princes on thy side, O Indra.</p><p>Let thy Bay Stallions, harnessed, bring thee hither, Steeds with strong chariot and strong reins to hold them, Strong Horses, speeding hither, bearing thunder, well-harnessed, for the stron exciting potion.</p><p>Beside the vat, Strong Deva! stand thy strong Horses, shining with holy oil, like waves exulting. Indra, they bring to thee, the Strong and Mighty, Soma of juices shed by mighty press-stones.</p><p>Thou art the Bull of Earth, the Bull of Heaven, Bull of the rivers, Bull of standing waters. For thee, the Strong, O Bull, hath Indu swollen. juice pleasant, sweet to drink, for thine election.</p><p>This Deva, with might, when first he had his being, with Indra for ally, held fast the Paá¹‡i. This Indu stole away the warlike weapons, and foiled the arts of his malignant father.</p><p>The Dawns he wedded to a glorious Consort, and set within the Sun the light that lights him. He found in Heaven, in the third lucid regions, the threefold Amá¹›ta in its close concealment.</p><p>He stayed and held the Heaven and Earth asunder: the chariot with the sevenfold reins he harnessed. This Soma Set with power within the milch-kine a spring whose ripe contents ten fingers empty.</p>
