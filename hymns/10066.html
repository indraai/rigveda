<p>I CALL the Devas of lofty glory for our weal, the makers of the light, well-skilled in offering;</p>

<p>I CALL the Devas of lofty glory for our weal, the makers of the light, well-skilled in offering; Those who have waxen mightily, Masters of all wealth, Immortal, strengthening Laws whom Indra leads.</p><p>For the strong band of Devas will we frame a hymn: the chiefs shall bring forth offering for Indra's troop, who, sent by Indra and advised by Varu&#7751;a, have gotten for themselves a share of S&#363;rya's light</p><p>May Indra with the Devas keep our dwelling safe, and Aditi with &#256;dityas lend us sure defence.</p><p>May the Deva Soma with the Somas favour us, and Tva&#7779;&#7789;ar with the Dames further us to success.</p><p>Aditi, Heaven and Earth, the great eternal Law, Indra, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, the Devas, and the lofty Sky. We call upon &#256;dityas, on the Devas, for help, on Devas, Somas, Indra of wondrous deeds.</p><p>With Holy Thoughts Sarasv&#257;n, firm-lawed Varu&#7751;a, great V&#257;yu, P&#363;&#7779;an, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, and the A&#347;vins Twain, Lords of all wealth, Immortal, furtherers of prayer, grant us a triply-guarding refuge from distress.</p><p>Strong be the offering, strong be the Holy Ones, strong the preparers of oblation, strong the Devas. Mighty be Heaven and Earth, true to eternal Law, strong be Parjanya, strong be they who laud the Strong.</p><p>To win us strength I glorify the Mighty Twain, Agni and Soma, Mighty Ones whom many laud, may these vouchsafe us shelter with a triple guard, these whom the strong have served in worship of the Devas.</p><p>Potent, with firm-fixt laws, arranging offering, visiting solemn rites in splendour of the day, Obeying Order, these whose priest is Agni, free from falsehood, poured the waters out when V&#7771;tra died.</p><p>The Holy Ones engendered, for their several laws, the heavens and Earth, the waters, and the plants and trees. They filled the Firmament with heavenly light for help: the Devas embodied Wish and made it beautiful.</p><p>May they who bear up Heaven, the &#7770;bhus deft of hand, and V&#257;ta and Parjanya of the thundering Bull, the waters and the plants, promote the songs we sing: come Bhaga, Rati, and the Vaijns to my call.</p><p>Sindhu, the sea, the region, and the Firmament, the thunder, and the ocean, Aja-Ekap&#257;d, the Dragon of the Deep, shall listen to my words, and all the Deities and Princes shall give ear.</p><p>May we, be yours, we men, to entertain the Devas: further our offering and give it full success. &#256;dityas, Somas, Devas, givers of good gifts, quicken the holy hymns which we are singing now</p><p>I follow with success upon the path of Law the two celestial Hotars, Monks of oldest time. We meditate to him who dwelleth near, Guard of the Field, to all Immortal Devas who never are remiss.</p><p>Vasi&#7779;&#7789;ha's sons have raised their voices, like their sire. &#7770;&#7779;i-like praying to the Devas for happiness. Like friendly-minded kinsmen, come at our desire, O Devas, and shake down treasures on us from above.</p><p>Immortal Devas have I, Vasi&#7779;&#7789;ha, lauded, Devas set on high above all other beings. May they this day grant us wide space and freedom: ye Devas, preserve us evermore with blessings.</p>
