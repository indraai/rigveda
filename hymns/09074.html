<p>BORN like a youngling he hath clamoured in the wood, when he, the Red, the Strong, would win the light of Heaven.</p>

<p>BORN like a youngling he hath clamoured in the wood, when he, the Red, the Strong, would win the light of Heaven.</p><p>He comes with heavenly seed that makes the water swell: him for wide-spreading shelter we implore with prayer.</p><p>A far-extended pillar that supports the sky the Soma-stalk, filled full, moves itself every way. He shall bring both these great worlds while the rite proceeds: the Sage holds these who move! together and all food.</p><p>Wide space hath he who follows Aditi's right path, and mighty, well-made food, meath blent with Soma juice; He who from hence commands the rain, Steer of the kine, Leader of floods, who helps us hence, who claims our laud.</p><p>Butter and milk are drawn from animated cloud; thence Am&#7771;ta is produced, centre of offering. Hini the Most Bounteous Ones, ever united, love; him as ouir Friend the Men who make all swell rain down.</p><p>The Soma-stalk hath roared, following with the wave: he swells with sap for man the skin which Devas enjoy. Upon the lap of Aditi he lays the germ, by means whereof we gain children and progeny.</p><p>In the third region which distils a thousand streams. May the Exhaustless Ones descend with procreant power. The kindred Four have been sent downward from the heavens: dropping with oil they bring Am&#7771;ta and sacred gifts.</p><p>Soma assumes white colour when he strives to gain: the bounteous Devas knows full many a precious boon. Down the steep slope, through song, he comes to offering, and he will burst the water-holding cask of Heaven,</p><p>Yea, to the shining milk-anointed beaker, as to his goal, hath stepped the conquering Courser. Pious-souled men have sent their giffi of cattle unto Kak&#7779;&#299;v&#257;n of the hundred winters.</p><p>Soma, thy juice when thou art blended with the streams, flows, Pavamana, through the long wool of the sheep. So, cleansed by sages. O best giver of delight, grow sweet for Indra, Pavamana! for his drink.</p>
