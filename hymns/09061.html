Riches and food with hero sons.</p><p>Him here, the Child whom streams have borne, the ten swift fingers beautify With the Ādityas is he seen.</p><p>With Indra and with Soma he, effused, flows onward with,the beams Of Sūrya to the cleansing sieve.</p><p>Flow rich in sweets and lovely for our Bhaga, Soma, Pūṣan flow For Mitra and for Indra.</p><p>High is thy juice's birth: though set in Heaven, on Earth it hath obtained Strong sheltering power and great renown.</p><p>Striving to win, with him we gain all wealth from the ungodly man, Yea, all the glories of mankind.</p><p>Finder of room and freedom, flow for Indra whom we must adore, for Indra and the Marut host.</p><p>The Devas have come to Indu well-descended, beautified with milk, the active crusher of the foe.</p><p>Even as mother cows their calf, so let our praise-songs strengthen him, Yea, him who winneth Indra's heart.</p><p>Soma, pour blessings on our kine, pour forth the food that streams with milk Increase the sea that merits laud.</p><p>From Heaven hath Indu made, as ’twere, the marvellous thunder, and The lofty light of all mankind.</p><p>The gladdening and auspicious juice of thee, of Indu, King! Flows o’er the woollen straining-cloth.</p><p>Thy juice, O Indu, sends its rays abroad like splendid skill, like lustre, all Heaven's light, to see.</p><p>Flow onward with that juice of thine most excellent, that brings delight, Slaying the wicked, dear to Devas.</p><p>Killing the foeman and his hate, and winning booty every day, Gainer art thou of steeds and kine.</p><p>Red-hued, be blended with the milk that seems to yield its lovely breast, Falcon-like resting in thine home.</p><p>Flow onward thou who strengthenedst Indra to slaughter Vṛtra who Compassed and stayed the mighty floods.</p><p>Soma who rainest gifts. May we win riches with our hero sons: Strengthen, as thou art cleansed, our hymns.</p><p>Aided by thee, and through thy grace. May we be slayers when we war: Watch, Soma, at our solemn rites.</p><p>Chasing our foemen, driving off the godless, Soma flowcth on, Going to Indra's special place.</p><p>O Indu, hither bring great riches, and destroy our foes: O Indu, grant heroic fame.</p><p>A hundred obstacles have ne’er checked thee when fain to give thy boons, when, being cleansed, thou combatest.</p><p>Indu, flow on, a mighty juice; glorify us among the folk: Drive all our enemies away.</p><p>Indu, in this thy friendship most lofty and gloriou. May we Subdue all those who war with us.</p><p>Those awful weapons that thou hast, sharpened at point to strike men down- Guard us therewith from every foe.</p>
