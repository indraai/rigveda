<h1>HYMN CLI. Mitra and Indra</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>HEAVEN and Earth trembled at the might and voice of him, whom, loved and Holy One, helper of all mankind, the wise who longed for spoil in fight for kine brought forth with power, a Friend, mid waters, at the offering.</p><p>As these, like friends, have done this work for you, these prompt servants of Purumīlha Soma-offerer, Give mental power to him who sings the sacred song, and hearken, Strong Ones, to the master of the house.</p><p>The folk have glorified your birth from Earth and Heaven, to be extolled, ye Strong Ones, for your mighty power.</p><p>Ye, when ye bring to singer and the rite, enjoy the offering performed with holy praise and strength.</p><p>The people prospers, Devass! whom ye dearly love: ye, Righteous Ones, proclaim aloud the Holy Law. That efficacious power that comes from lofty Heaven, ye bind unto the work, as to the pole an ox.</p><p>On this great Earth ye send your treasure down with might: unstained by dust, the crowding kine are in the stalls. Here in the neighbourhood they cry unto the Sun at morning and at evening, like swift birds of prey.</p><p>The flames with curling tresses serve your offering, whereto ye sing the song, Mitra and Indra. Send down of your free will, prosper our holy songs: ye are sole Masters of the singer's hymn of praise.</p><p>Whoso with sacrifices toiling brings you gifts, and worships, sage and priest, fulfilling your desire,— To him do ye draw nigh and taste his offerings. Come well-inclined to us unto our songs and prayer.</p><p>With sacrifices and with milk they deck you first, ye Righteous Ones, as if through stirrings of the mind. To you they bring their hymns with their collected thought, while ye with earnest soul come to us gloriously.</p><p>Rich strength of life is yours: ye, Heroes, have obtained through your surpassing powers rich far-extending might. Not the past days conjoined with nights, not rivers, not the Paṇis have attained your Godhead and your wealth.</p>
