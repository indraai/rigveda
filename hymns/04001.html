<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>, THEE Agni, have the Devas, ever of one accord, sent hither down, a Deva, appointed messenger, yea, with their wisdom sent thee down.</p><p>The Immortal, O thou Holy One, mid mortal men-devoted Deva, the wise, have they brought forth, brought forth the omnipresent Deva-devoted Sage.</p><p>As such, O Agni, bring with favour to the Devas thy Brother Varu&#7751;a who loveth offering, True to the Law, the &#256;ditya who supporteth men, the King, supporter of mankind.</p><p>Do thou, O Friend, turn hither him who is our Friend, swift as a wheel, like two car-steeds in rapid course, Wondrous! to us in rapid course. O Agni, find thou grace for us with Varu&#7751;a, with Devas who illumine all. Bless us, thou Radiant One, for seed and progeny, yea, bless us, O thou Wondrous God.</p><p>Do thou who knowest Varu&#7751;a, O Agni, put far away from us the Deva's displeasure. Best Offerer, brightest One, refulgent remove thou far from us all those who hate us.</p><p>Be thou, O Agni, nearest us with succour, our closest Friend while now this Morn is breaking. Reconcile to us Varu&#7751;a, be bounteous enjoy the gracious juice; be swift to hear us.</p><p>Excellent is the glance, of brightest splendour, which the auspicious God bestows on mortals- The Deva's glance, longed-for even as the butter, pure, heated, of the cow, the milch-cow's bounty.</p><p>Three are those births, the true, the most exalted, eagerly longed-for, of the Deva, of Agni. He came invested in the boundless region, pure, radiant, friendly, mightily resplendent.</p><p>This envoy joyeth in all seats of worship, borne on his golden car, sweet-tongued Invoker: Lovely to look on, with red steeds, effulgent, like a feast rich in food, joyous forever.</p><p>Allied by worship, let him give man knowledge: by an extended cord they lead him onward. He stays, effectual in this mortal's dwelling, and the Deva wins a share in his possessions.</p><p>Let Agni -for he knows the way- conduct us to all that he enjoys of God-sent riches, What all the Immortals have prepared with wisdom, Devas, Sire, begetter, raining down true blessings.</p><p>In houses first he sprang into existence, at great Heaven's base, and in this region's bosom; Footless and headless, both his ends concealing, in his Bull's lair drawing himself together.</p><p>Wondrously first he rose aloft, defiant, in the Bull's lair, the homeof holy Order, Longed-for, young, beautiful, and far-resplendent: and sevendear frieuds sprang up unto the Mighty.</p><p>Here did our human fathers take their places, fain to fulfil the sacred Law of worship. Forth drave they, with loud call, Dawn's teeming Milch-kine bid in the mountainstable, in the cavern.</p><p>Splendid were they when they had rent the mountain: others, around, shall tell forth this their exploit. They sang their song, prepared to free the cattle: they found the light; with holy hymns they worshipped.</p><p>Eager, with thought intent upon the booty, the men with their celestial speech threw open, the solid mountain firm, compact, enclosing, confining Cows, the stable full of cattle.</p><p>The Milch-cow's earliest name they comprehended: they found the Mother's thrice-seven noblest titles. This the bands knew, and sent forth acclamation:with the Bull's sheen the Red One was apparent.</p><p>The turbid darkness fled, the Heaven was sp, endid! up rose the bright beam of celestial Morning. S&#363;rya ascended to the wide expanses, beholding deeds of men both good and evil.</p><p>Then, afterwards they looked around, awakened, when first they held that Heaven allotted treasure. Now all the Devas abide in all their dwellings. Varu&#7751;a, Mitra, be the prayer effective.</p><p>I will call hither brightly-beaming Agni, the Herald, all-supporting, best at worship. He hath disclosed, like the milch cows' pure udder, the Sorria's juice when cleansed and poured from beakers.</p><p>The freest God of all who should be worshipped, the guest who is received in all men's houses, Agni who hath secured the Devas&#146; high favour,&#151;may he be gracious, to us J&#257;tavedas.</p>
