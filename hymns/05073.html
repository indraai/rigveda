<div class="box hymn"><p>WHETHER, O Indra, ye this day be far remote or near at hand, in many spots or in mid-air, come hither, Lords of ample wealth.</p><p>These here, who show o’er widest space, bringing full many a wondrous act, Resistless, lovingly I seek, I call the Mightiest to enjoy.</p><p>Another beauteous wheel have ye fixed there to decorate your car.</p><p>With others through the realms ye roam in might unto the neighbouring tribes.</p><p>That deed of yours that is extolled, Visvas! hath all been done with this. Born otherwise, and spotless, ye have entered kinship's bonds with us.</p><p>When Sūrya mounted on your car that rolls forever rapidly, Birds of red hue were round about and burning splendours compassed you.</p><p>Atri bethinks himself of you, O Heroes, with a friendly mind, what time, Nāsatyas, with his mouth he stirs the spotless flame for you.</p><p>Strong is your swiftly moving steed, famed his exertion in the course When by your great deeds, Indra, Chiefs, Atri is brought to us again.</p><p>Lovers of sweetness, Somas, she who streams with sweetness waits on you. When ye have travelled through the seas men bring you gifts of well-dressed food.</p><p>Indra, with truth they call you Twain bestowers of felicity; At offering most prompt to hear, most gracious ye at offering.</p><p>Most pleasing to the Indra be these prayers which magnify their might, Which we have fashioned, even as cars high reverence have we spoken forth.</p>
