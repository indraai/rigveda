<h1>HYMN CLXVI. Devas.</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>Now let us publish, for the vigorous company the herald of the Strong One, their primeval might.</p><p>With fire upon your way, O Devas loud of voice, with battle, Mighty Ones, achieve your deeds of strength.</p><p>Bringing the pleasant meath as ’twere their own dear son, they sport in sportive wise gay at their gatherings. The Somas come with succour to the worshipper; self-strong they fail not him who offers sacrifice.</p><p>To whomsoever, bringer of oblations, they immortal guardians, have given plenteous wealth, for him, like loving friends, the Devas bringing bliss bedew the regions round with milk abundantly.</p><p>Ye who with mighty powers have stirred the regions up, your coursers have sped forth directed by themselves. All creatures of the Earth, all dwellings are afraid, for brilliant is your coming with your spears advanced.</p><p>When they in dazzling rush have made the mountains roar, and shaken Heaven's high back in their heroic strength, Each sovran of the forest fears as ye drive near, aid the shrubs fly before you swift as whirling wheels.</p><p>Terrible Devas, ye with ne’er-diminished host, with great benevolence fulfil our heart's desire. Where’er your lightning bites armed with its gory teeth it crunches up the cattle like a well-aimed dart.</p><p>Givers of during gifts whose bounties never fail, free from ill-will, at sacrifices glorified, they sing their song aloud that the. May drink sweet juice: well do they know the Hero's first heroic deeds.</p><p>With castles hundredfold, O Devas, guard ye well the man whom ye have loved from ruin and from sin,— The man whom ye the fierce, the Mighty ones who roar, preserve from calumny by cherishing his seed.</p><p>O Devas, in your cars are all things that are good: great powers are set as ’twere in rivalry therein. Rings are upon your shoulders when ye journey forth: your axle turns together both the chariot wheels.</p><p>Held in your manly arms are many goodly things, gold chains are on your chests, and glistering ornaments, Deer-skins are on their shoulders, on their fellies knives: they spread their glory out as birds spread out their wings.</p><p>Mighty in mightiness, pervading, passing strong, visible from afar as ’twere with stars of Heaven, Lovely with pleasant tongues, sweet singers with their mouths, the Devas, joined with Indra, shout forth all around.</p><p>This is your majesty, ye Devas nobly born, far as the sway of Aditi your bounty spreads. Even Indra by desertion never disannuls the boon bestowed by you upon the pious man.</p><p>This is your kinship, Devas, that, Immortals, ye were oft in olden time regardful of our call, Having vouchsafed to man a hearing through this prayer, by wondrous deeds the Heroes have displayed their might.</p><p>That, O ye Devas, we may long time flourish through your abundant riches, O swift movers, and that our me. May spread in the encampment, let me complete the rite with these oblations.</p><p>May this your laud, may this your song, O Devas, bring food to feed us. May we find strengthening food in full abundance.</p>
