Come hither unto us, O A&#347;vins, with those aids wherewith ye help our thoughts to further holy acts.</p><p>Ye by the might which heavenly nectar giveth you are in supreme dominion Lords of all these folk. Come hither unto us, O A&#347;vins, with those aids wherewith ye. Heroes, made the barren cow give milk.</p><p>The aids wherewith the Wanderer through his offspring's might, or the Two-Mothered Son shows swiftest mid the swift; Wherewith the sapient one acquired his triple lore,&#151;Come hither unto us, O A&#347;vins, with those aids.</p><p>Wherewith ye raised from waters, prisoned and fast bound, Rebha, and Vandana to look upon the light; Wherewith ye succoured Ka&#7751;va as he strove to win,&#151;Come hither unto us, O A&#347;vins, with those aids.</p><p>Wherewith ye rescued Antaka when languishing deep in the pit, and Bhujyu with unfailing help. And comforted Karkandhu, Vayya, in their woe,&#151;Come hither unto us, O A&#347;vins, with those aids.</p><p>Wherewith ye gave &#346;ucanti wealth and happy home, and made the fiery pit friendly for Atri's sake; Wherewith ye guarded Purukutsa, P&#7771;&#347;nigu,&#151;Come hither unto us, O A&#347;vin;, with those aids.</p><p>Mighty Ones, with what powers ye gave Par&#257;v&#7771;j aid what time ye made the blind and lame to see and walk; Wherewith ye set at liberty the swallowed quail,&#151;Come hither unto us, O A&#347;vins, with those aids.</p><p>Wherewith ye quickened the most sweet exhaustless flood, and comforted Vasi&#7779;&#7789;ha, ye who ne&#146;er decay; And to &#346;rutarya, Kutsa, Narya gave your help,&#151;Come hither unto us, O A&#347;vins, with those aids.</p><p>Wherewith ye helped, in battle of a thousand spoils, Vi&#347;pal&#257; seeking booty, powerless to move.

In luckless game I call on you for succour: strengthen us also on the field of battle.</p><p>With, undiminished blessings, O ye A&#347;vins, forevermore both night and day protect us. This prayer of our. May Varu&#7751;a grant, and Mitra, and Aditi and Sindhu, Earth and Heaven.</p>
