<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>BOTH boons,&#151;may Indra, hitherward turned, listen to this prayer of ours, and mightiest Indra with thought inclined to us come near  juice.</p><p>For him, strong, independent Ruler. Heaven and Earth have fashioned forth for power and might.</p><p>Thou seatest thee as first among thy peers in place, for thy soul longs for Soma juice.</p><p>Fill thyself full, O Lord of wealth, O Indra, with the juice we shed. We know thee, Lord of Bay Steeds victor in the fight, vanquishing e&#146;en the invincible.</p><p>Changeless in truth, O Indra Indra, let it be as thou in wisdom willest it. May we, O fair of check, win booty with thine aid, O Thunderer, swiftly seeking it.</p><p>Indra, with all thy saving helps give us assistance, Lord of power. For after thee we follow even as glorious bliss, thee. Hero, finder-out of wealth.</p><p>Increaser of our steeds and multiplying kine, a golden well, art thou, for no on. May impair the gifts laid up in thee. Bring me whatever thing I ask.</p><p>For thou,&#151;come to the worshipper!&#151;wilt find great wealth to make us rich. Fill thyself full, O Indra, for gain of kine, full, Indra, for the gain of steeds.</p><p>Thou as thy gift bestowest many hundred herds, yea, many thousands dost thou give. With singers' hymns have we brought the Fort-render near, singing to Indra for his grace.</p><p>Whether the simple or the sage, Indra, have offered praise to thee. He &#346;atakratu! by his love hath gladdened thee, ambitious! ever pressing on!</p><p>If he the Strong of arm, the breaker-down of forts, the great Destroyer, hear my call, We, seeking riches cry to Indra, Lord of wealth, to &#346;atakratu with our lauds.</p><p>We count not then as sinners, nor as niggardly or foolish men, when with the Soma juice which we have shed we make Indra, the Mighty One, our Friend.</p><p>Him have we yoked in fight, the powerful Conqueror, debt-claimer, not to be deceived. Best charioteer, the Victor marks each fault, he knows the strong to whom he will come near.</p><p>Indra, give us security from that whereof we are afraid. Help us, O Indra, let thy succour give us this: drive away foes and enemies.</p><p>For thou, O liberal Lord of bounty, strengthenest his ample home who worships thee. So Indra, Indra, thou Lover of the Song, we with pressed Soma call on thee,</p><p>Indra is V&#7771;tra-slayer, guard, our best defender from the foe. May he preserve our last and middlemost, and keep watch from behind us and before.</p><p>Defend us from behind, below, above, in front, on all sides, Indra, shield us well. Keep far away from us the terror sent from Heaven: keep impious weapons far away.</p><p>Protect us, Indra, each to-day, each morrow, and each following day. Our singers, through all days, shalt thou, Lord of the brave, keep safely both by day and night.</p><p>A crushing Warrior, passing rich is Indra, endowed with all heroic might. Thine arms, O &#346;atakratu, are exceeding strong, arms which have grasped the thunderbolt.</p>
