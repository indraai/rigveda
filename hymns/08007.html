<div class="box hymn"><p>O MARUTS, when the sage hath poured the Tá¹›á¹£á¹­up forth as food for you, Ye shine amid the mountain-clouds.</p><p>When, Bright Ones, fain to show your might ye have determined on your course, the mountain-clouds have bent them down.</p><p>Loud roaring with the winds the Sons of Pá¹›Å›ni have upraised themselves: They have poured out the streaming food.</p><p>The Devas spread the mist abroad and make mountains rock and reel, when with the winds they go their way</p><p>What time the rivers and the hills before your coming bowed them down, So to sustain your mighty force.</p><p>We call on you for aid by night, on you for assist in the day, On you while offering proceeds.</p><p>These, verily, wondrous, red of hue, speed on their courses with a roar Over the ridges of the sky.</p><p>With might they drop the loosened rein so that the Su. May run his course, and spread themselves with beams of light.</p><p>Accept, ye Devas, this my song, accept ye this mine hymn of praise, accept, á¹šbhuká¹£ans, this my call.</p><p>The dappled Cows have poured three lakes, meath for the Thunder-wielding Deva, From the great cask, the watery cloud.</p><p>O Devas, quickly come to us when, longing for felicity, We call you hither from the sky.</p><p>For, Somas and á¹šbhuká¹£ans, ye, most Bountiful, are in the house, Wise when the gladdening draught is drunk.</p><p>O Devas, send us down from Heaven riches distilling rapturous joy, with plenteous food, sustaining all.</p><p>When, Bright Ones, hither from the hills ye have resolved to take your way, Ye revel in the drops effused.</p><p>Man should solicit with his lauds happiness which belongs to them, So great a band invincible.</p><p>They who like fiery sparks with showers of rain blow through the Heaven and Earth, Milking the spring that never fails.</p><p>With chariots and tumultuous roar, with tempests and with hymns of praise The Sons of Pá¹›Å›ni hurry forth.</p><p>For wealth, we think of that whereby ye aided Yadu, TurvaÅ›a, and KanVa who obtained the spoil.</p><p>May these our offerings Bounteous Ones I that flow in streams like holy oil, with Kaá¹‡va's hymns, increase your might.</p><p>Where, Bounteous Lords for whom the grass is trimmed, are ye rejoicing now? What Brahman is adoring you?</p><p>Is it not there where ye of old, supplied with sacred grass, for lauds Inspired the strong in offering?</p><p>They brought together both the worlds, the mighty waters, and the Sun, and, joint by joint, the thunderbolt.</p><p>They sundered Vá¹›tra limb from limb and split the gloomy mountain-clouds, Performing a heroic deed.</p><p>They reinforced the power and strength of Trita as he fought, and helped Indra in battle with the foe.</p><p>They deck themselves for glory, bright, celestial, lightning in their hands, and helms of gold upon their heads.</p><p>When eagerly ye from far away came to the cavern of the Bull. He bellowed in his fear like Heaven.</p><p>Borne by your golden-footed steeds, O Devas, come hither to receive The offering we offer you.</p><p>When the red leader draws along their spotted deer yoked to the car.</p><p>The Bright Ones come, and shed the rain.</p><p>Susoma, Saryakiavan, and Arjika full of homes, have they. These Heroes, sought with downward car.</p><p>When, Devas, ye come to him, the singer who invokes you thus, with favours to your suppliant?</p><p>What now? where have ye still a friend since ye left Indra all alone? Who counteth on your friendship now?</p><p>We sing forth Agni's praise together with our Devasâ€™ who Wield thunder and wear swords of gold.</p><p>Hither for new felicit. May I attract the Impetuous Ones, the Heroes with their wondrous strength</p><p>Before them sink the very hills deerning themseives abysses: yea, Even the mountains bend them down.</p><p>Steeds flying on their tortuous path through mid-air carry them, and give The man who lauds them strength and life.</p><p>Agni was born the first of all, like SÅ«rya lovely with his light: With lustre these have spread abroad.</p>
