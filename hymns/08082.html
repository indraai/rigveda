<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>SURYA, thou mountest up to meet the Hero famous for his wealth, who hurls the bolt and works for man</p><p>Him who with might of both his arms brake nine-and-ninety castles down, Slew Vá¹›tra and smote Ahi dead.</p><p>This Indra is our gracious Friend. He sends us in a full broad stream Riches in horses, kine, and corn.</p><p>Whatever, Vá¹›tra-slayer! thou, SÅ«rya, hast risen upon to-day, Tbat, Indra, all is in thy power.</p><p>When, Mighty One, Lord of the brave, thou thinkest thus, I shall not die, that thought of thine is true indeed.</p><p>Thou, Indra, goest unto all Soma libations shed for thee, Both far away and near at hand.</p><p>We make this Indra very strong to strike the mighty Vá¹›tra dead: A vigorous Hero shall he be.</p><p>Indra was made for giving, set, most mighty, oâ€™er the joyous draught.</p><p>Bright, meet for Soma, famed in song.</p><p>By song as â€™twere, the powerful bolt which non. May parry was prepared Lofty, invincible he grew.</p><p>Indra, Song-lover, lauded, make even in the wilds fair ways for us, whenever, Indra, thou wilt.</p><p>Thou whose commandment and behest of sovran sway none disregards, Neither audacious man nor Deva.</p><p>And both these Goddesses, Earth. Heaven, Lord of the beauteous helm! revere Thy might which no on. May resist.</p><p>Thou in the black cows and the red and in the cows with spotted skin This white milk hast deposited.</p><p>When in their terror all the Devas shrank from the Dragon's furious might, Fear of the monster fell on them.</p><p>Then he was my Defender, then, invincible, whose foe is not, showed his might.</p><p>Him your best Vá¹›tra-slayer, him the famous Champion of mankind I urge to great munificence,</p><p>To come, Much-lauded! Many-named with this same thought that longs for milk, wheneâ€™er the Soma juice is shed.</p><p>Much-honoured by libations. May wake for us: May Indra listen to our meditations.</p><p>O Hero, with that aid dost thou delight us, with what assist bring Riches to those who worship thee?</p><p>With whose libation joys the Strong, the Hero with his team who quells The foe,  juice?</p><p>Rejoicing in thy spirit bring thousandfold opulence to us: Enrich thy votary with gifts.</p><p>These juices with their wedded wives flow to enjoyment lovingly: To waters speeds the restless one.</p><p>Presented strengthening gifts have sent Indra away at offering, with might, onto the cleansing bath.</p><p>These two who share his feast, Bay Steeds with golden manes, shall bring him to The banquet that is laid for him.</p><p>For thee, O Lord of Light, are shed these Soma-drops, and grass is strewn Bring Indra to his worshippers.</p><p>May Indra give thee skill, and lights of Heaven, wealth to his votary And monks who praise him: laud ye him.</p><p>O Åšatakratu, wondrous strength and all our lauds I bring to thee: Be gracious to thy worshippers.</p><p>Bring to us all things excellent, food and strength: For, Indra, thou art kind to us.</p><p>Â§ O Åšatakratu, bring to us all blessings, all felicity: Fbr, Indra, thou art kind to us.</p><p>Bearing the Soma juice we call, best Vá¹›tra-slayer, unto thee: For, Indra, thou art kind to us.</p><p>Come, Lord of rapturous, joys, to our libation with thy Bay Steeds, come To our libation with thy Steeds.</p><p>Known as best Vá¹›tra-slayer erst, as Indra Åšatakratu, come With Bay Steeds to the juice we shed.</p><p>O Indra, thou art he who drinks these drops of Soma: come With Bay Steeds to the juice we shed.</p><p>May Indra give, to aid us, wealth handy that rules the Skilful Ones: Yea. May the Strong give potent wealth.</p>
