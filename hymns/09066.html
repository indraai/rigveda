<p>FOR holy lore of every sort, flow onward thou whom all men love.</p><p>A Friend to be besought by friends.</p><p>O'er all thou rulest with these Two which, Indu, stand, Turned, as thy stations, hitherward.</p><p>Wise Indu, thou encompassest on every side Thy stations as the seasons come.</p><p>Flow onward, generating food, for precious boons of every kind, a Friend for friends, to be our help.</p><p>Upon the lofty ridge of Heaven thy bright rays with their essences, Soma, spread purifying power.</p><p>O Soma, these Seven Rivers flow, as being thine, to give command: The Streams of milk run forth to thee.</p><p>Flow onward, Soma in a stream, effused to gladden Indra's heart, Bringing imperishable fame.</p><p>Driving thee in Vivasv&#257;n's course, the Seven Sisters with their hymns Made melody round thee the Sage.</p><p>The virgins deck thee o&#146;er fresh streams to drive thee to the sieve when thou, a singer, bathest in the wood.</p><p>The streams of Pavamana, thine, Sage, Mighty One, have pouredthem forth. Like coursers eager for renown.</p><p>They have been poured upon the fleece towards the meath-distilling vat: The holy songs have sounded forth.</p><p>Like milch-kine coming home, the drops of Soma juice have reached the lake, have reached the place of offering.</p><p>O Indu, to our great delight the running waters flow to us, when thou wilt robe thyself in milk.</p><p>In this thy friendship, and with thee to help us, fain to offering, Indu, we crave thy friendly love.</p><p>Flow on, O Soma, for the great Viewer of men, for gain of Idne Enter thou into Indra's throat.</p><p>Best art thou, Soma, of the great, Strongest of strong ones, Indu: thou As Warrior ever hast prevailed.</p><p>Mightier even than the strong, more valiant even than the brave, More libpral than the bountiful,</p><p>Soma, as S&#363;ra, bring us food, win offspring of our bodies: we Elect thee for our friendship, we elect thee for companionship.</p><p>Agni, thou pourest life; send down upon us food and vigorous strength; Drive thou misfortune far away,</p><p>Agni is Pavamana, Sage, Chief Monk of all the Races Five: To him whose wealth is great we pray.</p><p>Skilled in thy task, O Agni, pour splendour with hero strength on us, Granting me wealth that nourishes.</p><p>Beyond his enemies away to sweet praise Pavamana flows, like S&#363;rya visible to all.</p><p>Adorned by living men, set forth for entertainment, rich in food, Far-sighted Indu is a Steed.</p><p>He, Pavamana, hath produced the lofty Law, the brilliant light, Destroying darkness black of hue.</p><p>From tawny Pavamana, the Destroyer, radiant streams have sprung, Quick streams from him whose gleams are swift.</p><p>Best rider of the chariot, praised with fairest praise mid beauteous ones, Gold-gleaming with the Marut host,</p><p>May Pavamana, best to win the booty, penetrate with rays, giving the singer hero strength.</p><p>Over the fleecy sieve hath flowed the drop effused: to Indra comes Indu while he is purified</p><p>This Soma, through the pressing-stones, is sporting on the oxhide, and Summoning Indra to the draught.</p><p>O Pavamana, bless us, so that we may live, with that bright milk Of thine which hath been brought from Heaven.</p>
