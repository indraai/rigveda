<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>WISELY have I enjoyed the savoury viand, religious-thoughted, best to find out treasure, the food to which all Deities and mortals, calling it meath, gather themselves together.</p><p>Tlou shalt be Aditi as thou hast entered within, appeaser of celestial anger.</p><p>Indu, enjoying Indra's friendship, bring us&#151;as a swift steed the car&#151;forward to riches.</p><p>We have drunk Soma and become immortal; we have attained the lights discovered. Now wha. May foeman's malice do to harm us? What, O Immortal, mortal man's deception?</p><p>Absorbed into the heart, be sweet, O Indu, as a kind father to his son, O Soma, as a wise Friend to friend: do thou, wide-ruler, O Soma, lengthen out our days for living.</p><p>These glorious drops that give me freedom have I drunk. Closely they knit my joints as straps secure a car. Let them protect my foot from slipping on the way: yea, let the drops I drink preserve me from disease.</p><p>Make me shine bright like fire produced by friction: give us a clearer sight and make us better. For in carouse I think of thee, O Soma, Shall I, as a rich man, attain to comfort?</p><p>May we enjoy with an enlivened spirit the juice thou givest, like ancestral riches. O Soma, King, prolong thou our existence as S&#363;rya makes the shining days grow longer.</p><p>King Soma, favour us and make us prosper: we are thy devotees; of this be mindful. Spirit and power are fresh in us, O Indu give us not up unto our foeman's pleasure.</p><p>For thou hast settled in each joint, O Soma, aim of men's eyes and guardian of our bodies. When we offend against thine holy statutes, as a kind Friend, Deva, best of all, be gracious.</p><p>May I be with the Friend whose heart is tender, who, Lord of Bays! When quaffed will never harm me- This Soma now deposited within me. For this, I pray for longer life to Indra.</p><p>Our maladies have lost their strength and vanished: they feared, and passed away into the darkness. Soma hath risen in us, exceeding mighty, and we are come where men prolon existence.</p><p>, Fathers, that Indu which our hearts have drunken, Immortal in himself, hath entered mortals. So let us serve this Soma with oblation, and rest securely in his grace and favour.</p><p>Associate with the Fathers thou, O Soma, hast spread thyself abroad through Earth and Heaven. So with oblation let us serve thee, Indu, and so let us become the lords of riches,</p><p>Give us your blessing, O ye Devas&#146; preservers. Neve. May sleep or idle talk control us. But evermor. May we, as friends of Soma, speak to the synod with brave sons around us.</p><p>On all sides. Soma, thou art our life-giver: aim of all eyes, light-finder, come within us. Indu, of one accord with thy protections both from behind and from before preserve us.</p>
