<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>STREAM on us riches that are sought by many, best at winning strength Riches, O Indu, thousandfold, glorious, conquering the great.</p><p>Effused, he hath, as on a car, invested him in fleecy mail: Onward hath Indu flowed in streams, impelled, surrounded by the wood.</p><p>Effused, this Indu hath flowed on, distilling rapture, to the fleece: He goes erect, as seeking kine in stream, with light, to offering.</p><p>For thou thyself, O Indu, Deva, to every mortal worshipper Attractest riches thousandfold, made manifest in hundred forms.</p><p>Good V&#7771;tra-slayer. May we be still nearest to this wealth of thine Which many crave, nearest to food and happiness, Resistless One!</p><p>Whom, bright with native splendour, crushed between the pair of pressingstones- The wavy Friend whom Indra loves-the twice-five sisters dip and bathe,</p><p>Him with the fleece they purify, brown, golden-hued, beloved of all, who with exhilarating juice goes forth to all the Deities.</p><p>Through longing for this sap of yours ye drink what brings ability, Even him who, dear as Heaven's own light, gives to our princes high renown.</p><p>Indu at holy rites produced you, Heaven and Earth, the Friends of men, Hill-haunting God the Goddesses. They bruised him where the roar was loud.</p><p>For V&#7771;tra-subduing Indra, thou, Soma, art poured that h. May drink, Poured for the guerdon-giving man, poured for the Deva who sitteth there.</p><p>These ancient Somas, at the break of day, have flowed into the sieve, Snorting away at early morn these foolish evil-hearted ones.</p><p>Friends. May the princes, ye and we, obtain this Most Resplendent One.</p><p>Gain him who hath the smell of strength, win him whose home is very strength.</p>
