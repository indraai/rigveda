<p>To thee the Mighty One I bring this mighty hymn, for thy desire hath been gratified by my laud.</p><p>In Indra, yea in him victorious through his strengths have joyed at feast and when the Soma flowed.</p><p>The Seven Rivers bear his glory far and wide, and Heaven and sky and Earth display his comely form. The Sun and Moon in change alternate run their course, that we, O Indra, may behold an. May have faith.</p><p>Indra, grant us that same car to bring us spoil, thy conquering car in which we joy in shock of fight. Thou, Indra, whom our hearts praise highly in the war, grant shelter, Indra, to us who love thee well.</p><p>Encourage thou our side in every fight. May we, with thee for our ally, conquer the foeman's host. Indra, bestow on us joy and felicity break down, O Indra, the vigour of our foes.</p><p>For here in divers ways these men invoking thee, holder of treasures, sing hymns to win thine aid. Ascend the car that tho. Mayest bring spoil to us, for, Indra, thy fixt winneth the victory.</p><p>His arms win kine, his power is boundless in each act best, with a hundred helps, waker of battle's din Is Indra: non. May rival him in mighty strength. Hence, eager for the spoil the people call on him.</p><p>Thy glory, Indra, exceeds a hundred yea, more than a hundred, than a thousand mid the folk, the great bowl hath inspirited thee boundlessly: s. Mayst thou subdue the V&#7771;tras, breaker-down of forts!</p><p>Of thy great might there is a three counterpart, the three earths, Lord men and the three realms of light.

May Indra fill with spirit this our singer's heart, and make our car impetuous, foremost in attack.</p><p>Thou hast prevailed, and hast not kept the booty back, in trifling battles in those of great account. We make thee keen, the Mighty One, succour us: inspire us, Indra, when we defy the foe.</p><p>May Indra evermore be our Protector, and unimperille. May we win the booty. This prayer of our.
