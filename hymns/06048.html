<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>SING to your Agni with each song, at every offering, for strength.</p><p>Come, let us praise the Wise and Everlasting Deva, even as a well-beloved Friend,</p><p>The Son of Strength; for is he not our gracious Lord? Let us serve him who bears our gifts. In battl. May he be our help and strengthener, yea, be the saviour of our lives.</p><p>Agni, thou beamest forth with light, great Hero, never changed by time. Shining, pure Agni! with a light that never fades, beam with thy fair beams brilliantly.</p><p>Thou worshippest great Devas: bring them without delay by wisdom and thy wondrous power. O Agni, make them turn hither to succour us. Give strength, and win it for thyself.</p><p>He whom floods, stones, and trees support, the offspring of eternal Law; He who when rubbed with force is brought to life by men upon the lofty height of Earth;</p><p>He who hath filled both worlds fult with his brilliant shine, who hastens with his smoke to Heaven; He made himself apparent through the gloom by night, the Red Bull in the darksome nights, the Red Bull in the darksome nights.</p><p>O Agni, with thy lofty beams, with thy pure brilliancy, Kindled, most Youthful One! by Bharadv&#257;ja's hand, shine on us, O pure Deva, with wealth, shine, Purifier! splendidly.</p><p>Thou art the Lord of house and home of all the tribes, O Agni, of all tribes of men. Guard with a hundred forts thy kindler from distress, through hundred winters, Youngest God! and those who make thy singers rich.</p><p>Wonderful, with thy favouring help, send us thy bounties, gracious Lord. Thou art the Charioteer, Agni, of earthly wealth: find rest and safety for our seed.</p><p>With guards unfailing never negligent speed thou our children and our progeny. Keep far from us, O Agni, all celestial wrath and wickedness of godless men.</p><p>Hither, O friends, with newest song drive her who freely pours her milk; Loose her who never turns away;</p><p>Who, for the host of Devas bright with native sheen, hath shed immortal fame like milk; Whom the impetuous Devas look upon with love, who moves in splendour on their ways.</p><p>For Bharadv&#257;ja she poured down in days of old The milch-cow yielding milk for all, and food that gives all nourishment.</p><p>Your friend like Indra passing wise, with magic power like Varu&#7751;a. Like Aryaman joy-giving, bringing plenteous food like ViSnxu for my wish, I praise,</p><p>Bright as the host of Devas mighty in their roar. May they bring P&#363;&#7779;an free from foes; May they bring hither hundreds, thousands for our men. May they bring hidden stores to light, and make wealth easy to be found.</p><p>Haste to me, P&#363;&#7779;an, in thine car, bright Deity: I fain would speak: Most sinful is our foeman's hate.</p><p>Tear not up by the roots the Kakambira tree: destroy thou all malignity. Let them not snare by day the neck of that Celestial Bird the Sun.</p><p>Uninjured let thy friendship be, like the smooth surface of a skin, a flawless skin, containing curds, full to the mouth, containing curds.</p><p>For thou art high above mankind, in glory equal to the Devas. Therefore, O P&#363;&#7779;an, look upon us in the fight: now help us as in days of old.</p><p>May the kind excellence of him the Kind, loud Roarers! be our guide, be it the Deva's, O Devas, or a mortal man's who worships, ye impetuous Ones!</p><p>They whose high glory in a moment like the Deva, the Sun, goes round the space of Heaven, the Devas have obtained bright strength, a sacred name, strength that destroys the V&#7771;tras, strength V&#7771;tra-destroying excellent.</p><p>Once, only once, the Heaven was made, once only once, the Earth was formed- Once, only P&#7771;&#347;ni's milk was shed: no second, after this, is born.</p>
