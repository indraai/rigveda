<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>LET US with tuneful skill proclaim these generations of the Devas, that on. May see them when these hymns are chanted in a future age.</p><p>These Brahma&#7751;aspati produced with blast and smelting, like a Smith, Existence, in an earlier age of Devas, from Non-existence sprang.</p><p>Existence, in the earliest age of Devas, from Non-existence sprang.</p><p>Thereafter were the regions born. This sprang from the Productive Power.</p><p>Earth sprang from the Productive Power the regions from the Earth were born. Dak&#7779;a was born of Aditi, and Aditi was Dak&#7779;a's Child.</p><p>For Aditi, O Dak&#7779;a, she who is thy Daughter, was brought forth. After her were the blessed Devas born sharers of immortal life.</p><p>When ye, O Devas, in yonder deep closeclasping one another stood, thence, as of dancers, from your feet a thickening cloud of dust arose.</p><p>When, O ye Devas, like Yatis, ye caused all existing things to grow, then ye brought S&#363;rya forward who was lying hidden in the sea.</p><p>Eight are the Sons of Adid who from her body sprang to life. With seven she went to meet the Devas she cast Martanda far away.</p><p>So with her Seven Sons Aditi went forth to meet the earlier age. She brought Martanda thitherward to spring to life and die again.</p>
