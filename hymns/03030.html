<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>THE friends who offer Soma long to find thee: they pour forth Soma and present their offerings.</p><p>They bear unmoved the cursing of the people, for all our wisdom comes from thee, O Indra.</p><p>Not far for thee are mid-air's loftiest regions: start hither, Lord of Bays, with thy Bay Horses. Made for the Firm and Strong are these libations. The pressing-stones are set and fire is kindled.</p><p>Fair cheeks hath Indra, Indra, the Victor, Lord of a great host, Stormer, strong in action. What once thou didst in might when mortals vexed thee,&#151;where now, O Bull, are those thy hero exploits?</p><p>For, overthrowing what hath ne&#146;er been shaken, thou goest forth alone destroying V&#7771;tras. For him who followeth thy Law the mountains and Heaven and Earth stand as if firmly stablished.</p><p>Yea, Much-invoked! in safety through thy glories alone thou speakest truth as V&#7771;tra's slayer. E&#146;en these two boundless worlds to thee, O Indra, what time thou graspest them, are but a handful.</p><p>Forthwith thy Bay steeds down the steep, O Indra, forth, crushing foemen, go thy bolt of thunder! Slay those who meet thee, those who flee, who follow: make all thy promise true; be all completed.</p><p>The man to whom thou givest as Provider enjoys domestic plenty undivided. Blest, Indra, is thy favour dropping fatness: thy worship, Much-invoked! brings gifts in thousands.</p><p>Thou, Indra, Much-invoked! didst crush to pieces Kunaru handless fiend who dwelt with Danu. Thou with might, Indra, smotest dead the scorner, the footless V&#7771;tra as he waxed in vigour.</p><p>Thou hast established in her seat, O Indra, the level Earth, vast, vigorous, unbounded. The Bull hath propped the Heaven and air's mid-region. By thee sent onward let the floods flow hither.</p><p>He who withheld the kine, in silence I yielded in fear before thy blow, O Indra. He made paths easy to drive forth the cattle. Loud-breathing praises helped the Much-invoked One.</p><p>Indra alone filled full the Earth and Heaven, the Pair who meet together, rich in treasures. Yea, bring thou near us from the air's mid-region strength, on thy car, and wholesome food, O Hero.</p><p>S&#363;rya transgresses not the ordered limits set daily by the Lord of Tawny Coursers. When to the goal he comes, his journey ended, his Steeds he looses: this is Indra's doing.</p><p>Men gladly in the course of night would look on the broad bright front of the refulgent Morning; And all acknowledge, when she comes in glory, the manifold and goodly works of Indra.</p><p>A mighty splendour rests upon her bosom: bearing ripe milk the Cow, unripe, advances. All sweetness is collected in the Heifer, sweetness which Indra made for our enjoyment.</p><p>Barring the way they come. Be firm, O Indra; aid friends to offering and him who singeth. These must be slain by thee, malignant mortals, armed with ill arts, our quiverbearing foemen.</p><p>A cry is beard from enemies most near us: against them send thy fiercest-flaming weapon. Rend them from under, crush them and subdue them. Slay, Indra, and make the fiends our booty.</p><p>Root up the race of R&#257;k&#7779;asas, O Indra rend it in front and crush it in the middle. How long hast thou bebaved as one who wavers? Cast thy hot dart at him who hates devotion:</p><p>When borne by strong Steeds for our weal, O Leader, thou seatest thee at many noble offerings. May we be winners of abundant riches. May Indra be our wealth with store of children.</p><p>Bestow on us resplendent wealth. O Indra let us enjoy thine overflow of bounty. Wide as a sea our longing hath expanded, fulfil it, O thou Treasure-Lord of treasures.</p><p>With kine and horses satisfy this longing with very splendid bounty skill extend it. Seeking the light, with hymns to thee, O Indra, Ku&#347;ikas have brought their gift, the singers.</p><p>Lord of the kine, burst the kine's stable open: cows shall be ours, and strength that wins the booty. Hero, whose might is true, thy home is Heaven: to us, O Indra, grant gifts of cattle.</p><p>Call we on Indra, auspicious Indra, best Hero in this fight where spoil is gathered, the Strong who listens, who gives aid in battles, who subdues the V&#7771;tras, wins and gathers riches.</p>
