<h2>HYMN I. Indra.</h2>

<div class="box hymn"><p>GLORIFY naught besides, O Friends, so shall no sorrow trouble you.</p><p>Praise only might Indra, and say your lauds repeatedly.</p><p>Even him, eternal who is cause of both of enmity and peace, to both sides most munificent.</p><p>Although these men in sundry ways invoke thee to obtain thine aid, be this our meditation, addressed, O Indra, unto thee, thine exaltation every day.</p><p>Those skilled in song, O Indra among these men o‚Äôercome with might the foeman's songs. Come hither, bring us strength in many a varied form most near that he may assist us.</p><p>O Indra, I would not sell thee for a mighty price, Thunderer! Lord of countless wealth!</p><p>O Indra, thou art more to me than sire or brother is. O Indra, to give us wealth abundantly.</p><p>Where art thou? Whither art thou gone? For many a place attracts thy mind. Haste, Warrior, Lord of battle's din, haste, holy songs have sounded forth.</p><p>Sing out the song to him for his faithful friend, hymns to bring the Thunderer to , sit on sacred grass.</p><p>The Horses which are thine in tens, in hundreds, yea, in thousands thine, Even those vigorous Steeds, fleet-footed in the course, with those come quickly near to us.</p><p>This day I call the holy song, Indra  who provides unfailing food in ample stream.</p><p>With VƒÅta's rolling winged car, Indra, the unconquered One.</p><p>He without ligature closed up the wound again, most wealthy Indra, who maketh whole the injured part.</p><p>May we be never cast aside, and strangers, as it were, to thee. We, Thunder-wielding Indra, count ourselves as friends.</p><p>O Indra, we were thought slow and unready for the fray. Yet once in thy great bount, O Hero, after praising thee.</p><p>If he will listen to my laud,  Indra, Strengthener.</p><p>Come now unto the common laud of thee and of thy faithful friend. May our praise give joy to thee. Fain would I sing thine eulogy.</p><p>May our the waters wash it clean.</p><p>Whether thou come from Earth or from the lustre of the lofty Heaven, wax stronger in thy body through my song of praise: fill full all creatures, O most Wise.</p><p>Most gladdening and most excellent. May Indra make it swell sent forth with every prayer and asking, as it were, for strength.</p><p>Let me not, still beseeching thee with earnest song at Soma rites, Anger thee like some wild beast. Who would not beseech him who hath power to grant his prayer?</p><p>The draught made swift with rapturous joy, effectual with its mighty strength, All-conquering, distilling transport, let him drink, for he gives us gifts.</p><p>Where bliss is not. May he, All-praised, Deva whom the pious glorify, bestow great wealth upon the mortal worshipper who sheds the juice and praises him.</p><p>Come, Indra, and rejoice thyself, in manifold affluence. Thou fillest like a lake thy vast capacious bulk with Soma and with draughts besides.</p><p>A thousand and a hundred Steeds are harnessed to thy golden car. May the long-maned Bays, yoked by devotion, bring Indra  juice.</p><p>Yoked to thy chariot wrought of gold. May thy two Bays with peacock tails, Convey thee hither, Steeds with their white backs, to quaff sweet juice that makes us eloquent.</p><p>So drink, thou Lover of the Song, as the first drinker, of this juice. This the outpouring of the savoury sap prepared is good and meet to gladden thee.</p><p>He who alone by wondrous deed is Mighty, Strong by holy works, may he come, fair of cheek. May he not stay afar, but come and hear our call.</p><p>In the quick moving castle, Indra, from of old, hast followed after light.</p><p>My praises when the Sun hath risen, my praises at the time of noon, My praises at the coming of the gloom of night, O Indra, have gone forth to thee.</p><p>Praise yea, praise him.</p><p>When to the car, by faith, he yoked the horses longing for the way.</p><p>May he with their cloths of gold, may he, ƒÄsa·πÖga's son Svanadratha, obtain all joy and high felicities.</p>
<p>What time his perfect restoration to his lost strength and manhood, now art thou well, my lord, and shalt be happy.</p>
