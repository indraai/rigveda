<h1>HYMN XXI.</h1>
<p>To him the Lord of all, the Lord of wealth, of light;</p>
</section>
<main>
<p>To him the Lord of all, the Lord of wealth, of light; him who is Lord forever, Lord of men and tilth, him who is Lord of horses, Lord of kine, of floods, to Indra, to the Holy bring sweet Soma juice.</p><p>To him the potent One, who conquers and breaks down, the Victor never vanquished who disposes all, the mighty-voiced, the rider, unassailable, to Indra everconquering speak your reverent prayer.</p><p>Still Victor, loved by mortals, ruler over men, o&#146;erthrower, warrior, he hath waxen as he would; Host-gatherer, triumphant, honoured mid the folk. Indra's heroic deeds will I tell forth to all.</p><p>The strong who never yields, who slew the furious fiend, the deep, the vast, of wisdom unattainable; Who speeds the good, the breaker-down, the firm, the vast,&#151;Indra whose rites bring joy hath made the light of Dawn.</p><p>By offering the yearning sages sending forth their songs found furtherance from him who speeds the flood.</p><p>In Indra seeking help with worship and with hymn, they drew him to themselves and won them kine and wealth.</p><p>Indra, bestow on us the best of treasures, the spirit of ability and fortune; Increase of riches, safety of our bodies, charm of sweet speech, and days of pleasant weather.</p>
