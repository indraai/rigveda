<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>WE as thy friends have chosen thee, mortals a Deva, to be our help, the Waters&#146; Child, the blessed, the resplendent One, victorious and beyond compare.</p><p>Since thou delighting in the woods hast gone unto thy mother streams, Not to be scorned, Agni, is that return of thine when from afar thou now art here.</p><p>O'er pungent smoke host thou prevailed, and thus art thou benevolent.</p><p>Some go before, and others round about thee sit, they in whose friendship thou hast place.</p><p>Him who had passed beyond his foes, beyond continual pursuits, him the unerring Ones, observant, found in floods, couched like a lion in his lair.</p><p>Him wandering at his own free will, Agni here hidden from our view, him M&#257;tari&#347;van brought to us from far away produced by friction, from the Devas.</p><p>O Bearer of Oblations, thus mortals received thee from the Devas, Whilst thou, the Friend of man, guardest each offering with thine own power, most Youthful One.</p><p>Amid thy wonders this is good, yea, to the simple is it clear, when gathered round about thee, Agni, lie the herds where thou art kindled in the morn.</p><p>Offer to him who knows fair rites, who burns with purifying glow, Swift envoy, active, ancient, and adorable: serve ye the Deva attentively.</p><p>Three times a hundred Devas and thrice a thousand, and three times ten and nine have worshipped Agni, for him spread sacred grass, with oil bedewed him, and stablished him as Monk and Offerer.</p>
