<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>BRING forth your gifts to his refulgent splendour, your hymn as purest offering to Agni, to him who goes as messenger with knowledge between all songs of men and Devas in Heaven.</p><p>Wise must this Agni be, though young and tender, since he was born, most Youthful. He who with bright teeth seizeth fast the forests, and eats his food, though plenteous, in a moment.</p><p>Before his presence must we all assemble, this Deva's whom men have seized in his white splendour.</p><p>This Agni who hath brooked that men should seize him hath shone for man with glow insufferable.</p><p>Far-seeing hath this Agni been established, deathless mid mortals, wise among the foolish. Here, O victorious Deva, forbear to harm us. May weforever share thy gracious favour.</p><p>He who hath occupied his Deva-made dwelling, Agni, in wisdom hath surpassed Immortals. A Babe unborn, the plants and trees support him, and the Earth beareth him the All-sustainer.</p><p>Agni is Lord of the gift of wealth and hero valour, Victorious Deva, let us not sit about thee like men devoid of strength, beauty, and worship.</p><p>May we be masters of our own possessions. Agni, no son is he who springs from others: lengthen not out the pathways of the foolish.</p><p>Unwelcome for adoption is the stranger, one to be thought of as another's offipring, Though grown familiar by continual presence. May our strong hero come, freshly triumphant.</p><p>Guard us from him who would assail us, preserve us O thou Victor, from dishonour. May wealth be ours, desirable, in thousands.</p><p>Shine this felicity on us, O Agni. May we attain to perfect understanding. All happiness be theirs who sing and praise thee. Ye Devas, preserve us evermore with blessings.</p>
