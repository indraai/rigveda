<p>HE lighting up the flame shall conquer enemies: strong shall he be who offers prayer and brings his gift.</p>

<p>HE lighting up the flame shall conquer enemies: strong shall he be who offers prayer and brings his gift.</p><p>He with his seed spreads forth beyond another's seed, whomever Brahma&#7751;aspati takes for his friend.</p><p>With heroes he shall overcome his hero foes, and spread his wealth by kine wise by himself is be. His children and his children's children grow in strength, whomever Brahma&#7751;aspati takes for his friend.</p><p>He, mighty like a raving river's billowy flood, as a bull conquers oxen, overcomes with strength. Like Agni's blazing rush h. May not be restrained, whomever Brahma&#7751;aspati takes for his friend.</p><p>For him the floods of Heaven flow never failing down: first with the heroes he goes forth to war for kine. He subdues in unabated vigour with great might, whomever Brahma&#7751;aspati takes for his friend.</p><p>All roaring rivers pour their waters down for him, and many a flawless shelter hath been granted him. Blest with the happiness of Devas he prospers well, whomever Brahma&#7751;aspati takes for his friend.</p>
