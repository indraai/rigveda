<p>THE monks of him the lofty Monk well-skilled in hymns harness their spirit, yea, harness their holy thoughts.</p><p>He only knowing works assigns their priestly tasks. Yea, lofty is the praise of Indra the Deva.</p><p>The Sapient One arrays himself in every form: for quadruped and biped he hath brought forth good. Excellent Indra hath looked on Heaven's high vault, and shineth after the outgoing of the Dawn.</p><p>Even he whose going-forth and majesty the other Deities have followed with their might, He who hath measured the terrestrial regions out by his great power, he is the Courser Indra.</p><p>To the three spheres of light thou goest, Indra, and with the rays of Sidrya thou combinest thee. Around, on both sides thou encompassest the night: yea, thou, art Mitra through thy righteous laws.</p><p>Over all generation thou art Lord alone: P&#363;&#7779;an art thou, in all thy goings-forth. Yea, thou hast domination over all this world. &#346;y&#257;v&#257;&#347;va hath brought praise to thee, O Indra,</p>
