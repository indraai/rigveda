<p>MINISTERS, bring the Soma juice for Indra, pour forth the gladdening liquor with the beakers.</p><p>To drink of this the Hero longeth ever; offer it to the Bull, for this he willeth.</p><p>Ye ministers, to him who with the lightning smote, like a tree, the rain-withholding V&#7771;tra&#151; Bring it to him, him who is fain to taste it, a draught of this which Indra here deserveth.</p><p>Ye ministers, to him who smote D&#7771;bh&#299;ka, who drove the kine forth, and discovered Vala, Offer this draught, like Vita in the region: clothe him with Soma even as steeds with trappings.</p><p>Him who did Ura&#7751;a to death, Adhvaryus! though showing arms ninety-and-nine in number; Who cast down headlong Arbuda and slew him,&#151;speed ye that Indra to our offered Soma.</p><p>Ye ministers, to him who struck down Sva&#347;na, and did to death Vya&#7745;sa and greedy &#346;u&#7779;&#7751;a, and Rudhikr&#257;s and Namuci and Pipru,&#151;to him, to Indra, pour ye forth libation.</p><p>Ye ministers, to him who as with thunder demolished &#346;ambara's hundred ancient castles; Who cast down Varcin's sons, a hundred thousand,&#151;to him, to Indra, offer ye the Soma.</p><p>Ye ministers, to him who slew a hundred thousand, and cast them down upon Earth's bosom; Who quelled the valiant men of Atithigva, Kutsa, and &#256;yu,&#151;bring to him the Soma.</p><p>Ministers, men, whatever thing ye long for obtain ye quickly bringing gifts to Indra. Bring to the Glorious One what bands have cleansed; to Indra bring, ye pious ones, the Soma.</p><p>Do ye, O ministers, obey his order: that purified in wood, in wood uplift ye. Well pleased he longs for what your hands have tended: offer the gladdening Soma juice to Indra.</p><p>As the cow's udder teems with milk, Adhvaryus, so fill with Soma Indra, liberal giver. I know him: I am sure of this, the Holy knows that I fain would give to him more largely.</p><p>Him, ministers, the Lord of heavenly treasure and all terrestrial wealth that Earth possesses, him, Indra, fill with Soma as a garner is filled with barley full: be this your labour.</p><p>Prepare thyself to grant us that great booty, O Vasu, for abundant is thy treasure. Gather up wondrous wealth, O Indra, daily. Lou. May we speak, with heroes, in assembly.</p>
