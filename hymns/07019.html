<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>HE like a bull with sharpened horns, terrific, singly excites and agitates all the people: Thou givest him who largely pours libations his goods who pours not, for his own possession.</p><p>Thou, verily, Indra, gavest help to Kutsa, willingly giving car to him in battle, when, aiding &#256;rjuneya, thou subduedst to him both Kuyava and the D&#257;sa &#346;u&#7779;&#7751;a.</p><p>O Bold One, thou with all thine aids hast boldly holpen Sud&#257;s whose offerings were accepted, P&#363;ru in winning land and subduing foemen, and Trasadasyu son of Purukutsa.</p><p>At the Devas&#146; banquet, hero-souled! with Heroes, Lord of Bay Steeds, thou slewest many foemen.</p><p>Thou sentest in swift death to sleep the Dasyu, both Cumuri and Dhuni, for Dabh&#299;ti.</p><p>These were thy mighty powers that, Thunder-wielder, thou swiftly crushedst nine-and-ninety castles: Thou capturedst the hundredth in thine onslaught; thou slewest Namuci, thou slewest V&#7771;tra.</p><p>Old are the blessings, Indra, which thou gavest Sud&#257;s the worshipper who brought oblations. For thee, the Strong, I yoke thy strong Bay Horses. May our meditations reach thee and win strength, most Mighty!</p><p>Give us not up, Lord of Bay Horses, Victor, in this thine own assembly, to the wicked. Deliver us with true and faithful succours: dea. May we be to thee among the princes.</p><p>May we men, Indra, the friends thou lovest, near thee be joyful under thy protection. Fain to fulfil the wish of Atithigva humble. the pride of Turva&#347;a and Yadva.</p><p>Swiftly, in truth, O Indra, about thee men skilled in hymning sing their songs and praises. ' Elect us also into their assembly who by their calls on thee despoiled the niggards.</p><p>Thine are these lauds, O manliest of heroes, lauds which revert to us and give us riches. Favour these, Indra, when they fight with faemen, as Friend and Hero and the heroes' Helper.</p><p>Now, lauded for thine aid. Heroic Indra, sped by our meditation, wax mighty in thy body. Apportion to us strength and habitations. Ye Devas, protect us evermore with blessings.</p>
