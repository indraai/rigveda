<h2>HYMN XIX. Indra.</h2>

<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>GREAT, hero-like controlling men is Indra, unwasting in his powers, doubled in vastness.</p><p>He, turned to us, hath grown to hero vigour: broad, wide, he hath been decked by those who serve him.</p><p>The bowl made Indra swift to gather booty, the High, the Lofty, Youthful, Undecaying, him who hath waxed by strength which non. May conquer, and even at once grown to complete perfection.</p><p>Stretch out those hands of thine, extend to us-ward thy wide capacious arms, and grant us glory. Like as the household herdsman guards the cattle, so move thou round about us in the combat.</p><p>Now, fain for strength, let us invite your Indra hither, who lieth hidden with his Heroes,&#151; Free from all blame, without reproach, uninjured, e&#146;en as were those who sang, of old, his praises.</p><p>With steadfast laws, wealth-giver, strong through Soma, he hath much fair and precious food to feed us. In him unite all paths that lead to riches, like rivers that commingle with the ocean.</p><p>Bring unto us the mightiest might, O Hero, strong and most potent force, thou great Subduer! All splendid vigorous powers of men vouchsafe us, Lord of Bay Steeds, that the. May make us joyful.</p><p>Bring us, grown mighty in its strength, O Indra, thy friendly rapturous joy that wins the battle, Wherewith by thee assisted and triumphant, we may laud thee in gaining seed and offspring.</p><p>Indra, bestow on us the power heroic skilled and exceeding strong, that wins the booty, Wherewith, by thine assistance, we may conquer our foes in battle, be they kin or stranger.</p><p>Let thine heroic strength come from behind us, before us, from above us or below us. From every sid. May it approach us, Indra. Give us the glory of the realm of splendour.</p><p>With most heroic aid from thee, like heroes Indra, may we win wealth by deeds glory. Thou, King, art Lord of earthly, heavenly treasure: vouchsafe us riches vast, sublime, and lasting.</p><p>The Bull, whose strength hath waxed, whom Devas follow, free-giving Indra, the Celestial Ruler, Mighty, all-conquering, the victory-giver, him let us call to grant us new protection.</p><p>Give up the people who are high and haughty to these men and to me, O Thunder-wielder! Therefore upon the Earth do we invoke thee, where heroes win, for sons and kine and waters.</p><p>Through these thy friendships, God invoked of many. May we be victors over every foeman. Slaying both kinds of foe. May we, O Hero, be happy, helped by thee, with ample riches.</p>
