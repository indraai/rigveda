<h1>HYMN XXXIII. &#7770;bhus.</h1>
<p>I SEND my voice as herald to the &#7770;</p>

<p>I SEND my voice as herald to the &#7770;bhus; I crave the white cow for the overspreading.</p><p>Wind-sped, the Skillful Ones in rapid motion have in an instant compassed round the Heaven.</p><p>What time the Rbus had with care and marvels done proper service to assist their Parents, they won the friendship of the Devas; the Sages carried away the fruit of their devotion.</p><p>May they who made their Parents, who were lying like posts that moulder, young again forever,&#151; May V&#257;ja, Vibhvan, &#7770;bhu, joined with Indra , protect our offering, the Soma-lovers.</p><p>As for a year the &#7770;bhus kept the Milch-cow, throughout a year fashioned and formed her body, and through a year's space still sustained her brightness, through these their labours they were made immortal.</p><p>Two beakers let us make,&#151;thus said the eldest. Let us make three,&#151;this was the younger's sentence. Four beakers let us make,&#151;thus spoke the youngest. Tva&#7779;&#7789;ar approved this rede of yours, O &#7770;bhus.</p><p>The men spake truth and even so they acted: this Godlike way of theirs the &#7770;bhus followed. And Tva&#7779;&#7789;ar, when he looked on the four beakers resplendent as the day, was moved with envy.</p><p>When for twelve days the &#7770;bhus joyed reposing as guests of him who neve. May be hidden, they made fair fertile fields, they brought the rivers. Plants spread o&#146;er deserts, waters filled the hollows.</p><p>May they who formed the swift car, bearing Heroes, and the Cow omniform and all-impelling, Eve. May they form wealth for us,&#151;the &#7770;bhus, dexterous-handed, deft in work and gracious.</p><p>So in their work the Devas had satisfaction, pondering it with thought and mental insight. The Devas&#146; expert artificer was V&#257;ja, Indra's &#7770;bhuk&#7779;an, Varu&#7751;a's was Vibhvan.</p><p>They who made glad with offering and praises, wrought the two Bays, his docile Steeds, for Indra,&#151; &#7770;bhus, as those who wish a friend to prosper, bestow upon us gear and growth of riches.</p><p>This day have they set gladdening drink before you. Not without toil are Devas inclined to friendship. Therefore do ye who are so great, O &#7770;bhus, vouchsafe us treasures at this third libation.</p>
