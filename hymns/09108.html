He, Excellently Wise, is come to strengthening food, to spoil and wealth like Eta&#347;a.</p><p>For, verily, Pavamana, thou hast, splendidest, called all the generations of The Devas to immortality.</p><p>By whom Dadhyac Navagva opens fastened doors, by whom the sages gained their wish, by whom they won the fame of lovely Am&#7771;ta in the felicity of Devas.</p><p>Effused, he floweth in a stream, best rapture-giver, in the long wool of the sheep, Sporting, as &#146;twere the waters' wave.</p><p>He who from out the rocky cavern took with might the redmrefulgent watery Cows, Thou masterest the stable full of kine and steeds: burst it, brave Lord, like one in mail.</p><p>Press ye and pour him, like a steed, laudworthy, speeding through the region and the flood, who swims in water, roan in wood;</p><p>Increaser of the water, Steer with thousand streams, dear to the race of Deities. Who born in Law hath waxen mighty by the Law, King, Deva, and lofty Ordinance.</p><p>Make splendid glory shine on us, thou Lord of strengthening food, Deva, as the Friend of Devas: Unclose the fount of middle air.</p><p>Roll onward to the bowls, O Mighty One, effused, as Prince supporter of the tribes.</p><p>Pour on us rain from Heaven, send us the waters' flow: incite our thoughts to win the spoil.</p><p>They have drained him the Steer of Heaven, him with a thousand streams, distilling rapturous joy, him who brings all things excellent.</p><p>The Mighty One was born Immortal, giving life, lightening darkness with his shine. Wcll-praised by. sages he hath. by his wondrous power assumed the Threefold as his robe.</p><p>Effused is he who brings good things, who brings us bounteous gifts and sweet refreshing food, Soma who brings us quiet homes:</p><p>He whom our Indra and the Marut host shall drink, Bhaga shall drink with Aryarnan, by whom we bring to us Mitra and Varu&#7751;a and Indra for our great defence.</p><p>Soma, for Indra's drink do thou, led by the men, well-wcaponcd and most gladdening, Flow on with greatest store of sweets.</p><p>Enter the Soma-holder, even Indra's heart, as rivers pass into the sea, acceptable to Mitra, V&#257;yu, Varu&#7751;a, the noblest Pillar of the heavens.</p>
