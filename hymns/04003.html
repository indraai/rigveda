<div class="box hymn"><p>WIN, to assist you, Soma, Lord of worship, Monk of both worlds, effectual Offerer, Agni, invested with his golden colours, before the thunder strike and lay you senseless.</p><p>This shrine have we made ready for thy coming, as the fond dame attires her for her husband.</p><p>Performer of good work, sit down before us, invested while these flames incline to meet thee.</p><p>A hymn, O Monk, to him who hears, the gentle, to him who looks on men, exceeding gracious, a song of praise sing to the Deva Immortal, whom the stone, presser of the sweet juice, worships.</p><p>Even as true knower of the Law, O Agni, to this our solemn rite he thou attentive. When shall thy songs of festival be sung thee? When is thy friendship shown within our dwelling?</p><p>Why this complaint to Indra, O Agni? And why to Heaven? for what is our transgression? How wilt thou speak to Earth and bounteous Mitra? What wilt thou say to Aryaman and Bhaga?</p><p>What, when thou blazest on the lesser altars, what to the mighty Wind who comes to bless us, True, circumambient? what to Earth, O Agni, what wilt thou say to man-destroying Soma?</p><p>How to great P≈´·π£an who promotes our welfare.to honoured Soma what, who gives oblations? What sin of ours to the far-striding Indra, what, Agni, wilt thou tell the Lofty Arrow.</p><p>What wilt thou tell the truthful band of Devas, how answer the great Sun when thou art questioned? Before the Free, before the Swift, defend us: fulfil Heaven's work, all-knowing JƒÅtavedas.</p><p>I crave the cow's true gift arranged by Order: though raw, she hath the sweet ripe juice, O Agni. Though she is black of hue with milk she teemeth, nutritious, brightly shining, all-sustaining.</p><p>Agni the Bull, the manly, hath been sprinkled with oil upon his back, by Law eternal. He who gives vital power goes on unswerving. P·πõ≈õni the Bull hath milked the pure wiiite udder.</p><p>By Law the A·πÖgirases cleft the rock asunder, and sang their hymns together with the cattle. Bringing great bliss the men encompassed Morning: light was apparent at the birth of Agni.</p><p>By Law the Immortal Goddesses the Waters, with meath-rich waves, O Agni, and uninjured, like a strong courser lauded in his running, sped to flow onward swiftly and forever.</p><p>Go never to the feast of one who harms us, the treacherous neighbour or unworthy kinsman. Punish us not for a false brother's trespass. Let us not feel the might of friend or foeman.</p><p>O Agni, keep us safe with thy protection, loving us, honoured Deva! and ever guarding. Beat thou away, destroy severe affliction subdue e‚Äôen the demon when he waxes mighty.</p><p>Through these our songs of praise be gracious, moved by our meditations, O Hero, touch our offerings. Accept, O A·πÖgiras, these our devotions, and let the praise which Devas desire address thee.</p><p>To thee who knowest, Agni, thou Disposer, all these wise secret speeches have I uttered, Sung to thee, Sage, the charming words of wisdom, to thee, O Singer, with. my thoughts and Praises.</p>
