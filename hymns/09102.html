<p>THE Child, when blended with the streams, speeding the plan of offering, Surpasses all things that are dear, yea, from of old.</p>

<p>THE Child, when blended with the streams, speeding the plan of offering, Surpasses all things that are dear, yea, from of old.</p><p>The place, near the two pressing-stones of Trita, hath he occupied, Secret and dear through seven lights of offering.</p><p>Urge to three courses, on the heights of Trita, riches in a stream.</p><p>He who is passing wise measures his courses out.</p><p>Even at his birth the Mothers Seven taught him, for glory, like a sage, So that he, firm and sure, hath set his mind on wealth.</p><p>Under his sway, of one accord, are all the guileless Deities: Warriors to be envied, they, when they are pleased.</p><p>The Babe whom they who strengthen Law have generated fair to see, Much longed for at the offering, most liberal Sage,&#151;</p><p>To him, united, of themselves, come the young Parents of the rite, when they adorn him, duly weaving offerings.</p><p>With wisdom and with radiant eyes unbar to us the stall of Heaven, Speeding at solemn rite the plan of Holy Law.</p>
