<h2>HYMN LI. Indra.</h2>

<main>
<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>HIGH hymns have sounded forth the praise of Indra, supporter of mankind, of Indra meet for lauds; Him who hath waxen great, invoked with beauteous songs, Immortal One, whose praise each day is sung aloud.</p><p>To Indra from all sides go forth my songs of praise, the Lord of Hundred Powers, strong. Hero, like the sea, Swift, winner of the booty, breaker-down of forts, faithful and ever-glorious, finder of the light.</p><p>Where battle's spoil is piled the singer winneth praise, for Indra taketh care of matchless worshippers.</p><p>He in Vivasv&#257;n's dwelling findeth his delight: praise thou the ever-conquering slayer of the foe.</p><p>Thee, valorous, most heroic of the heroes, shall the monks glorify with songg and praises. Full of all wondrous power he goes to conquest: worship is his, sole Lord from days aforetime.</p><p>Abundant are the gifts he gives to mortals: for him the Earth bears a rich store of treasures. The heavens, the growing plants, the living waters, the forest trees preserve their wealth for Indra.</p><p>To thee, O Indra, Lord of Bays, forever are offered prayers and songs: accept them gladly. As Kinsman think thou of some fresh assistance; good Friend, give strength and life to those who praise thee.</p><p>Here, Indra, drink thou Soma with the Devas, as thou didst drink the juice beside &#346;&#257;ry&#257;ta. Under thy guidance, in thy keeping. Hero, the singers serve, skilled in fair offers.</p><p>So eagerly desirous drink the Soma, our juice, O Indra, with thy friends the Devas, Since at thy birth all Deities adorned thee for the great fight, O thou invoked of many.</p><p>He was your comrade in your zeal, O Devas: they, rich in noble gifts, rejoiced in Indra. With them together let the V&#7771;tra-slayer drink in his home the worshipper's libation.</p><p>So, Lord of affluent gifts, this juice hath been pressed for thee with strength Drink of it, thou who lovest song.</p><p>Incline thy body to this juice which suits thy Godlike nature well: May it cheer thee who lovest it.</p><p>Brave Indra, let it work through both thy flanks, and through thy head by prayer, and through thine arms, to prosper us.</p>
