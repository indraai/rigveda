<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>HITHERWARD! they who light flame and straightway trim the sacred grass.</p><p>Whose Friend is Indra ever young.</p><p>High is their fuel, great their laud, wide is their splinter from the stake, whose Friend is Indra ever young.</p><p>Unequalled in fight the hero leads his army with the warrior chiefs. Whose Friend is Indra ever young.</p><p>The new-born Vá¹›tra-slayer asked his Mother, as he seized his shaft, who are the fierce? Who are renowned?</p><p>ÅšavasÄ« answered. He who seeks thine enmity will battle like a stately elephant on a hill.</p><p>And hear, O Indra; to him who craves of thee thou grantest all Whateâ€™er thou makest firm is firm.</p><p>What time the Warrior Indra goes to battle, borne by noble steeds, best of all charioteers is he.</p><p>Repel, O Thunder-armed, in all directions all attacks on us: And be our own most glorious Deva.</p><p>May Indra set our car in front, in foremost Place to win the spoil. He whom the wicked injure not.</p><p>Thine enmit. May we escape, and, Indra, for thy bounty, rich In kine. May we come near to thee</p><p>Softly approaching, Thunder-armed wealthy by hundreds, rich in steeds, Unrivalled, ready with our gifts.</p><p>For thine exalted excellence gives to thy worshippers each day Hundreds and thousands of thy boons.</p><p>Indra, we know thee breaker-down even of strong forts, winner of spoil, as one who conquers wealth for us.</p><p>Though thou art highest, Sage and Bold! let the drops cheer thee when we come To thee as to a trafficker.</p><p>Bring unto us the treasure of the opulent man who, loth to give, Hath slighted thee for gain of wealth.</p><p>Indra, these friends of ours, supplied with Soma, wait and look to thee, as men with fodder to the herd.</p><p>And thee who art not deaf, whose cars are quick to listen, for our aid, We call to us from far away.</p><p>When thou hast listened, make our call one which thou never wilt forget, and be our very nearest Friend.</p><p>When even now, when we have been in trouble, we have thought of thee, O Indra, give us gifts of kine.</p><p>O Lord of Strength, we rest on thee, as old men rest upon a staff: We long to have. thee dwell with us.</p><p>To Indra sing a song of praise. Hero of mighty valour, him Whom no one challenges to war.</p><p>Hero, the Soma being shed, I pour the juice for thee to drink: Sate thee and finish thy carouse.</p><p>Let not the fools, or those who mock beguile thee when they seek thine aid Love not the enemies of prayer.</p><p>Here let them with rich milky draught cheer thee to great munificence: Drink as the wild-bull drinks the lake.</p><p>Proclaim in our assemblies what deeds, new and ancient, far away, hath achieved.</p><p>In battle of a thousand arms Indra drank KadrÅ«'s Soma juice: There he displayed his manly might.</p><p>True undeniable strength he found in Yadu and in TurvaÅ›a, and conquered through the offering.</p><p>Him have I magnified, our Lord in, common, Guardian of your folk, Discloser of great wealth in kine;</p><p>á¹šbhuká¹£an, not to be restrained, who strengthened Tugra's son in lauds, Indra beside the flowing juice;</p><p>Who for TriÅ›oka clave the hill that formed a wide receptacle, So that the cows might issue forth.</p><p>Whateâ€™er thy plan or purpose be, whateâ€™er, in transport, thou wouldst do, Do it not, Indra, but be kind.</p><p>But little hath been heard of done upon the Earth by one like thee i Let thine heart, Indra, turn to us.</p><p>Thine then shall be this high renown, thine shall these lofty praises be, when, Indra, thou art kind to us.</p><p>Not for one trespass, not for two, O Hero, subdue us, nor for three, Nor yet for many trespasses.</p><p>I fear one powerful like thee, the crusher-down of enemies, Mighty, repelling all attacks.</p><p>O wealthy Deva, neâ€™e. May I live to see my friend or son in need: Hitherward let thy heart be turned.</p><p>What friend, O people, unprovoked, hath ever said unto a friend. He turns and leaves us in distress?</p><p>Hero, insatiate enjoy this Soma juice so near to thee, Even as a hunter rushing down.</p><p>Hither I draw those Bays of thine yoked by our hymn, with splendid car, that tho. Mayst give unto the monks.</p><p>Drive all our enemies away, smite down the foes who press around, and bring the wealth for which we long:</p><p>O Indra, that which is concealed in strong firm place precipitous: Bring us the wealth for which we long</p><p>Great riches which the world of men shall recognize as sent by thee: Bring us the wealth for which we long.</p>
