<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>I LAUD the seven-rayed, the triple-headed, Agni all-perfect in his Parentsâ€™ bosom, Sunk in the lap of all that moves and moves not, him who hath filled all luminous realms of Heaven.</p><p>As a great Steer he grew to these his Parents; sublime he stands, untouched by eld, far-reaching.</p><p>He plants his footsteps on the lofty ridges of the broad Earth: his red flames lick the udder.</p><p>Coming together to their common youngling both Cows, fairshaped, spread forth in all directions, Measuring out the paths that must be travelled, entrusting all desires to him the Mighty.</p><p>The prudent sages lead him to his dwelling, guarding with varied skill the Ever-Youthful. Longing, they turned their eyes unto the River: to these the Sun of men was manifested.</p><p>Born noble in the regions, aim of all mensâ€™ eyes to be implored for life by great and small alike, Far as the Wealthy One hath spread himself abroad, he is the Sire all-visible of this progeny.</p>
