<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>MAY Agni, Indra, Mitra, Varu&#7751;a consent, Aryaman, V&#257;yu, P&#363;&#7779;an, and Sarasvat&#299;, &#256;dityas, Devas, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, Soma, lofty Sky, Soma and Aditi, and Brahma&#7751;aspati.</p><p>Indra and Agni. Hero-lords when V&#7771;tra fell, dwelling together, speeding emulously on, and Soma blent with oil, putting his greatness forth, have with their power filled full the mighty Firmament.</p><p>Skilled in the Law I lift the hymn of praise to these, Law-strengtheners, unassailed, and great in majesty.</p><p>These in their wondrous bounty send the watery sea. May they as kindly Friends send gifts to make us great.</p><p>They with their might have stayed Heaven, Earth, and Prthivi, the Lord of Light, the Firmament, -the lustrous spheres. Even as fleet-foot steeds who make their masters glad, the princely Devas are praised, most bountiful to man.</p><p>Bring gifts to Mitra and to Varu&#7751;a who, Lords of all, in spirit never fail the worshipper, whose statute shines on high through everlasting Law, whose places of sure refuge are the heavens and Earth.</p><p>The cow who yielding milk goes her appointed way hither to us as leader of holy rites, Speaking aloud to Varu&#7751;a and the worshipper, shall with oblation serve Vivasv&#257;n and the Devas.</p><p>The Devas whose tongue is Agni dwell in Heaven, and sit, aiders of Law, reflecting, in the seat of Law. They propped up Heaven and then brought waters with their might, got offering and in a body made it fair.</p><p>Born in the oldest time, the Parents dwelling round are sharers of one mansion in the home of Law. Bound by their common vow Devas, Prthivi stream forth the moisture rich in oil to Varu&#7751;a the Steer.</p><p>Parjanya, V&#257;ta, mighty, senders of the rain, Indra and V&#257;yu, Varu&#7751;a, Mitra, Aryaman: We call on Aditi, &#256;dityas, and the Devas, those who are on the Earth, in waters, and in Heaven.</p><p>Tva&#7779;&#7789;ar and V&#257;yu, those who count as &#7770;bhus, both celestial Hotar-monks, and Dawn for happiness, Winners of wealth, we call, and wise B&#7771;haspati, destroyer of our foes, and Soma Indra's Friend.</p><p>They generated prayer, the cow, the horse, the plants, the forest trees, the Earth, the waters, and the hills. These very bounteous Devas made the Sun mount to Heaven, and spread the righteous laws of &#256;ryas o&#146;er the land.</p><p>O A&#347;vins, ye delivered Bhujyu from distress, ye animated &#346;y&#257;va, Vadhrmati's son. To Vimada ye brought his consort Kamadyu, and gave his lost Vi&#7779;&#7751;&#257;p&#363; back to Vi&#347;vaka.</p><p>Thunder, the lightning's daughter, Aja-Ekap&#257;d. Heaven's bearer, Sindhu, and the waters of the sea: Hear all the Devas my words, Sarasvat&#299; give ear together with Purandhi and with Holy Thoughts.</p><p>With Holy Thoughts and with Purandh. May all Devas, knowing the Law immortal, Manu's Holy Ones, Boon-givers, favourers, finders of light, and Heaven, with gracious love accept my songs, my meditation, my hymn.</p><p>Immortal Devas have I, Vasi&#7779;&#7789;ha, lauded, Devas set on high above all other beings. May they this day grant us wide space and freedom: ye Devas, preserve us evermore with blessings.</p>
