<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>IN the beginning rose Hiranyagarbha, born Only Lord of all created beings.</p><p>He fixed and holdeth up this Earth and Heaven. What Deva shall we adore with our oblation?</p><p>Giver of vital breath, of power and vigour, he whose commandments all the Devas acknowledge -. The Lord of death, whose shade is life immortal. What Deva shall we adore with our oblation?</p><p>Who by his grandeur hath become Sole Ruler of all the moving world that breathes and slumbers; He who is Loord of men and Lord of cattle. What Deva shall we adore with our oblation?</p><p>His, through his might, are these snow-covered mountains, and men call sea and Rasā his possession: His arms are these, his are these heavenly regions. What Deva shall we adore with our oblation?</p><p>By him the heavens are strong and Earth is stedfast, by him light's realm and sky-vault are supported: By him the regions in mid-air were measured. What Deva shall we adore with our oblation?</p><p>To him, supported by his help, two armies embattled look while trembling in their spirit, when over them the risen Sun is shining. What Deva shall we adore with our oblation?</p><p>What time the mighty waters came, containing the universal germ, producing Agni, thence sprang the Devas’ one spirit into being. What Deva shall we adore with our oblation?</p><p>He in his might surveyed the floods containing productive force and generating Worship. He is the Deva of gods, and none beside him. What Deva shall we adore with our oblation?</p><p>Nee. May he harm us who is Earth's Begetter, nor he whose laws are sure, the heavens' Creator. He who brought forth the great and lucid waters. What Deva shall we adore with our oblation?</p><p>Prajāpati! thou only comprehendest all these created things, and none beside thee. Grant us our hearts' desire when we invoke thee. May we have store of riches in possession.</p>
