<div class="box hymn"><p>GLORIFY thou Soma, the scatheless, who must be praised with hymns, sweet-tongued and mighty, to whom as leader of the song, resplendent, worthy of lauds, both Devas and mortals listen.</p><p>On him wait songs according to the season even as a stream of pious men set moving.</p><p>Somaâ€”for he laid out the expansesâ€”was, at the offering.</p><p>The praise, the verse that offers adoration. May he bring forth, as the Sun sends his arms out. He who gives daily light through this Deva's wisdom, strong as a dread wild beast, and inoffensive.</p><p>His song of praise pervades the Earth and Heaven: let the wise worshipper draw it, like a courser. These of Soma, like hunters' arrows, go to the skies that change their hue like serpents.</p><p>Those, Deva, who count thee as a worthless bullock, and, wealthy sinners, live on thee the Bounteous. On fools like these no blessing thou bestowest: Soma, thou punishest the spiteful.</p><p>Like a fair path is he, where grass is pleasant, though hard to win, a friend beloved most early. Those who unharmed by enemies behold us, while they would make them bare, stood closely compassed.</p><p>He to whom songs of praise go forth like torrents, as rivers eddying under banks flow sea-wardâ€” Soma the wise, the eager, closely looks upon both, the waters and the vessel.</p><p>So hath Soma, great, strong and mighty exceeding powerful, been brought hither. May he thus lauded give to us. May we find strengthening food in full abundance.</p>
