<h1>HYMN XXXVI. Indra.</h1>
<p>THY raptures ever were for all men's profit: so evermore have been thine earthly riches.</p>
</section>
<main>
<p>THY raptures ever were for all men's profit: so evermore have been thine earthly riches.</p><p>Thou still hast been the dealer-forth of vigour, since among Devas thou hast had power and Godhead.</p><p>Men have obtained his strength by sacrificing, and ever urged him, on to hero valour. For the rein-seizing, the impetuous Charger they furnished power even for V&#7771;tra's slaughter.</p><p>Associate with him, as teams of horses, help, manly might, and vigour follow Indra. As rivers reach the sea, so, strong with praises, our holy songs reach him the Comprehensive.</p><p>Lauded by us, let flow the spring, O Indra, of excellent and brightly-shining riches. For thou art Lord of men, without an equal: of all the world thou art the only Sovran.</p><p>Hear what tho. Mayst hear, thou who, fain for worship, as Heaven girds Earth, guardest thy servant's treasure; Tlat tho. Mayst be our own, joying in power, famed through thy might in every generation.</p>
