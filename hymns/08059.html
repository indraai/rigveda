<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>HE who, as Sovran Lord of men, moves with his chariots unrestrained, the V&#7771;tra-slayer vanquisher, of fighting hosts, preeminent, is praised with song.</p><p>Honour that Indra, Puruhanman! for his aid, in whose sustaining hand of old, the splendid bolt of thunder was deposited, as the great Sun was set in Heaven.</p><p>No one by deed attains to him who works and strengthens evermore: No, not by offering, to Indra. praised o all, resistless, daring, bold in might.</p><p>The potent Conqueror, invincible in war, him at whose birth the Mighty Ones, the Kine who spread afar, sent their loud voices out, heavens, earths seat their loud voices out,</p><p>O Indra, if a hundred heavens and if a hundred earths were thine&#151; No, not a thousand Suns could match thee at thy birth, not both the worlds, O Thunderer.</p><p>Thou, Hero, hast performed thy hero deeds with might, yea, all with strength, O Strongest One.</p><p>Indra, help us to a stable full of kine, O Thunderer, with wondrous aids.</p><p>Let not a godless mortal gain this food, O thou whose life is long! But one who yokes the bright-hued steeds, the Etasas, even Indra yoker of the Bays.</p><p>Urge ye the Conqueror to give, your Indra greatly to be praised, to be invoked in shallow waters and in depths, to be invoked in deeds of might.</p><p>O Vasu, O thou Hero, raise us up to ample opulence. Raise us to gain of mighty wealth, O Indra, to sublime renown.</p><p>Indra, thou justifiest us, and tramplest down thy slanderers. Guard thyself, valiant Hero, in thy vital parts: strike down the D&#257;sa with thy blows.</p><p>The man who brings no offering, inhuman, godless, infidel, him let his friend the mountain cast to rapid death, the mountain cast the Dasyu down.</p><p>O Mightiest Indra, loving us, gather thou up, as grains of corn, within thine hand, of these their kine, to give away, yea, gather twice as loving us.</p><p>O my companions, wish for power. Ho. May we perfect Sara's praise, the liberal princely patron, never to be harmed?</p><p>By many a sage whose grass is trimmed thou art continually praised, that thou, O Sara, hast bestowed here one and here another calf.</p><p>The noble, Suradeva's son, hath brought a calf, led by the car to three of us. As a chief brings a goat to milk.</p>
