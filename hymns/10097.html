<h2>HYMN XCVII. Praise of Herbs.</h2>

<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>HERBS that sprang up in time of old, three ages earlier than the Devas,&#151; Of these, whose hue is brown, will I declare the hundred powers and seven.</p><p>Ye, Mothers, have a hundred homes, yea, and a thousand are your growths.</p><p>Do ye who have a thousand powers free this my patient from disease.</p><p>Be glad and joyful in the Plants, both blossoming and bearing fruit, Plants that will lead us to success like mares who conquer in the race.</p><p>Plants, by this name I speak to you, Mothers, to you the Goddesses: Steed, cow, and garmen. May I win, win back thy very self, O man.</p><p>The Holy Fig tree is your home, your mansion is the Parna tree: Winners of cattle shali ye be if ye regain for me this man.</p><p>He who hath store of Herbs at hand like Kings amid a crowd of men,&#151; Physician is that sage's name, fiend-slayer, chaser of disease.</p><p>Herbs rich in Soma, rich in steeds, in nourishments, in strengthening power,&#151; All these have I provided here, that this ma. May be whole again.</p><p>The healing virtues of the Plants stream forth like cattle from the stall,&#151; Plants that shall win me store of wealth, and save thy vital breath, O man.</p><p>Reliever is your mother's name, and hence Restorers are ye called. Rivers are ye with wings that fly: keep far whatever brings disease.</p><p>Over all fences have they passed, as steals a thief into the fold. The Plants have driven from the frame whatever malady was there.</p><p>When, bringing back the vanished strength, I hold these herbs within my hand, the spirit of disease departs ere he can seize upon the life.</p><p>He through whose frame, O Plants, ye creep member by member, joint by joint,&#151; From him ye drive away disease like some strong arbiter of strife.</p><p>Fly, Spirit of Disease, begone, with the blue jay and kingfisher. Fly with the wind's impetuousspeed, vanish together with the storm.</p><p>Help every one the other, lend assistance each of you to each, All of you be accordant, give furtherance to this speech of mine.</p><p>Let fruitful Plants, and fruitless, those that blossom, and the blossomless, Urged onward by B&#7771;haspati, release us from our pain and grief;</p><p>Release me from the curse's plague and woe that comes from Varu&#7751;a; Free me from Yama's fetter, from sin and offence against the Devas.</p><p>What time, descending from the sky, the Plants flew earthward, thus they spake: No evil shall befall the man whom while he liveth we pervade,</p><p>Of all the many Plants whose King is, Soma, Plants of hundred forms, Thou art the Plant most excellent, prompt to the wish, sweet to the heart.</p><p>O all ye various Herbs whose King is Soma, that o&#146;erspread the Earth, Urged onward by B&#7771;haspati, combine your virtue in this Plant.</p><p>Unharmed be he who digs you up, unharmed the man for whom I dig: And let no malady attack biped or quadruped of ours.</p><p>All Plants that hear this speech, and those that have departed far away, Come all assembled and confer your healing power upon this Herb.</p><p>With Soma as their Sovran Lord the Plants hold colloquy and say: O King, we save from death the man whose cure a Brahman undertakes.</p><p>Most excellent of all art thou, O Plant thy vassals are the trees. Let him be subject to our power, the man who seeks to injure us.</p>
