<p>THE Cow, the famous Mother of the wealthy Devas, pours her milk: Both horses of the cars are yoked,&#151;</p><p>She in whose bosom all the Devas, and Sun and Moon for men to see, Maintain their everlasting Laws.</p><p>This all the pious sing to us, and sacred poets evermore: The Devas to the Soma-draught</p><p>Here is the Soma ready pressed of this the Devas drink, of this Self-luminous the A&#347;vins drink.</p><p>Of this, moreover, purified, set in three places, procreant, Drink Varu&#7751;a, Mitra, Aryaman.</p><p>And Indra, like the Herald Monk, desirous of the milky juice, At early morn will quaff thereof.</p><p>When have the Princes gleamed and shone through waters as through troops of foes'? When hasten they whose might ispure?</p><p>What favour do I claim this day of you great Deities, you who are Wondrously splendid in yourselves?</p><p>1 call, , those Devas who spread all realms of Earth And luminous regions of the sky.</p><p>You, even such, pure in your might, you, O ye Devas, I invoke From Heaven to drink this Somajuice.</p><p>The Devas, those who have sustained and propped the heavens and Earth apart, I call to drink this Soma juice.</p><p>That vigorous band of Devas that abidetb in the mountains, I Invoke to drink this Soma juice.</p>
