<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>To this our offering come Ṛbhu, Vibhvan, Vāja, and Indra with the gift of riches, because this day hath Dhiṣaṇā the Goddess set drink for you: the gladdening draughts have reached you.</p><p>Knowing your birth and rich in gathered treasure, Ṛbhus, rejoice together with the Ṛtus.</p><p>The gladdening draughts and wisdom have approached you: send ye us riches with good store of heroes.</p><p>For you was made this offering, O Ṛbhus, which ye, like men, won for yourselves aforetime. To you come all who find in you their pleasure: ye all were—even the two elder—Vājas.</p><p>Now for the mortal worshipper, O Heroes, for him who served you, was the gift of riches. Drink, Vājas, Ṛbhus! unto you is offered, to gladden you, the third and great libation.</p><p>Come to us. Heroes, Vājas and Ṛbhukṣans, glorified for the sake of mighty treasure. These draughts approach you as the day is closing, as cows, whose calves are newly-born, their stable.</p><p>Come to this offering of ours, ye Children of Strength, invoked with humble adoration. Drink of this meath, Wealth-givers, joined with Indra with whom ye are in full accord, ye Princes.</p><p>Close knit with Indra drink the Soma, Indra; close-knit, Hymn-lover! with the Devas drink it: Close-knit with drinkers first, who drink in season; close-knit with heavenly Dames who give us treasures.</p><p>Rejoice in full accord with the Ādityas, in concord with the Parvatas, O Ṛbhus; In full accord with Indra, Divine One; in full accord with floods that pour forth riches.</p><p>Ṛbhus, who helped their Parents and the Aśvins, who formed the Milch-cow and the pair of horses, Made armour, set the Heaven and Earth asunder.far- reaching Heroes, they have made good offspring.</p><p>Ye who have wealth in booty, in heroes, in rich sustenance and treasure, Such, O ye Ṛbhus, first to drink, rejoicing, give unto us and those who laud our present.</p><p>Ye were not far: we have not left you thirsting, blameless in this our offering, O Ṛbhus. Rejoice you with the Devas and with Indra, with the Kings, Devas! that y. May give us riches.</p>
