<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>INVITE ye Indra with a song to drink your draught of Soma juice, All-conquering Åšatakratu, most munificent of all who live.</p><p>Lauded by many, much-invoked, leader of song, renowned of old: His name is Indra, tell it forth.</p><p>Indra the Dancer be to us the giver of abundant strength: May he, the mighty, bring it near.</p><p>Indra whose jaws are strong hath drunk of worshipping Sudaksa's draught, the Soma juice with barley mixt.</p><p>Call Indra loudly with your songs of praise  juice.</p><p>For this is what augments his stiength.</p><p>When he hath drqnk its gladdening drops with vigour of a Deva Hath far surpassed all things that are.</p><p>Thou speedest down to assist us this ever-conquering Deva of yours, him who is drawn to all our songs</p><p>The Warrior not to he restrained, Soma neâ€™er oâ€™erthrown, the Chieftain of resistless might.</p><p>O Indra, send us riches, thou Omniscient, worthy of our praise: Help us in the decisive fray.</p><p>Even thence, O Indra, come to us with food that gives a hundred powers, with food that gives a thousand powers.</p><p>We sought the wisdom of the wise. Indra, Kine-giver, Thunder-armed! May we with steeds oâ€™ercome in fight.</p><p>We make thee, Åšatakratu, find enjoyment in the songs we sing. Like cattle in the pasture lands.</p><p>For, Åšatakratu, Thunder-armed, all that we craved, as men are wont, All that we hoped, have we attained.</p><p>Those, Son of Strength, are come to thee who cherish wishes in their hearts O Indra, non excelleth thee.</p><p>So. Hero, guard us with thy care, with thy most liberal providence, Speedy, and terrible to foes.</p><p>O Åšatakratu Indra, now rejoice with that carouse of thine Which is most splendid of them all</p><p>Even, Indra, that carouse which subdues the Vá¹›tras best, most widely famed, best giver of thy power and might.</p><p>For that which is thy gift we know, true Soma-drinker, Thunder-armed, Mighty One, amid all the folk.</p><p>For Indra, Lover of Carouse, loud be our songs about the juice: Let poets sing the song of praise.</p><p>We summon Indra to the draught, irl whom all glories rest, in whom The seven communities rejoice.</p><p>At the Trikadrukas the Devas span offering that stirs the mind: Let our songs aid and prosper it.</p><p>Let the drops pass within thee as the rivers flow into the sea: O fndra, naught excelleth thee.</p><p>Thou, wakeful Hero, by thy might hast taken food of Soma juice, Which, Indra, is within thee now.</p><p>O Indra, Vá¹›tra-slayer, let Soma be ready for thy maw, the drops be ready for thy forms.</p><p>Now Srutakaksa sings his song that cattle and the stee. May come, that Indra's very sel. May come.</p><p>Here, Indra, thou art ready by our Soma juices shed for thee, Indra, at hand that tho. Mayst give.</p><p>Even from far away our songs reach thee, O Caster of the Stone: May we come very close to thee.</p><p>For so thou art the hero's Friend, a Hero, too, art thou, and strong: May thine heart be won to us.</p><p>So hath the offering, wealthiest Lord, been paid by all the worshippers: So dwell thou, Indra, even with me.</p><p>Be not thou like a slothfid priest, O Lord of spoil and wealth: rejoice In the pressed Soma blent with milk.</p><p>O Indra, let not ill designs surround us in the sunbeams' light: Thi. May we gain with thee for Friend.</p><p>With thee to help us, Indra, let us answer all our enemies: For thou art ours and we are thine.</p><p>Indra, the poets and thy friends, faithful to thee, shall loudly sing Thy praises as they follow thee.</p>
