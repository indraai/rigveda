<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>PRIEST of all offers hast thou been appointed by the Devas, Agni, amid the race of man.</p><p>So with thy joyous tongues for us offering nobly in this rite.</p><p>Bring thou the Devas and worship them.</p><p>For well, Disposer, thou knowest, straight on, the paths and ways, Agni, most wise in offering.</p><p>Thee, too, hath Bh&#257;rata of old, with mighty men, implored for bliss. And worshipped thee the worshipful.</p><p>Thou givest these abundant boons to Divod&#257;sa pouring forth, to Bharadv&#257;ja offering gifts.</p><p>Do thou, Immortal Messenger, bring hither the Celestial Folk; Hearing the singer's eulogy.</p><p>Mortals with pious thought implore thee, Agni, Deva, at holy rites, to come unto the feast of Devas.</p><p>I glorify thine aspect and the might of thee the Bountilul. All those who love shall joy in thee,</p><p>Invoker placed by Manus, thou, Agni, art near, the wisest Monk: Pay worship to the Tribes of Heaven.</p><p>Come, Agni, lauded, to the feast; come to the offering of the gifts. As Monk be seated on the grass.</p><p>So, A&#7749;giras, we make thee strong with fuel and with holy oil. Blaze high, thou youngest of the Devas.</p><p>For us thou winnest, Agni, Deva, heroic strength exceeding great and of high renown.</p><p>Agni, Atharvan brought thee forth, by rubbing, from the lotus-flower, the head of Visva, of the Monk.</p><p>Thee. V&#7771;tra's slayer, breaker down of castles, hath Atharvan's son, Dadhyac the &#7770;&#7779;i, lighted up.</p><p>The hero Pathya kindled thee the Dasyus'. most destructive foe, Winner of spoil in every fight.</p><p>Come, here, O Agni, will I sing verily other songs to thee, and with these drops shalt thou grow strong.</p><p>Where&#146;er thy mind applies itself, vigour preeminent hast thou: There wilt thou gain a dwelling-place.</p><p>Not for a moment only lasts thy bounty, good to many a one! Our service therefore shalt thou gain.</p><p>Agni, the Bh&#257;rata, hath been sought, the V&#7771;tra-slayer, marked of all, Yea, Divod&#257;sa's Hero Lord.</p><p>For he gave riches that surpass in greatness all the things of Earth, Fighting untroubled, unsubdued.</p><p>Thou, Agni, as in days of old, with recent glory, gathered light, Hast overspread the lofty Heaven.</p><p>Bring to your Agni, O my friends, boldly your laud and offering: Give the Disposer praise and song.</p><p>For as sagacious Herald he hath sat through every age of man, Oblation-bearing messenger.</p><p>Bring those Two Kings whose ways are pure, &#256;dityas, and the Marut host, Excellent God! and Heaven and Earth.</p><p>For strong and active mortal man, excellent, Agni, is the look Of thee Immortal, Son of Strength</p><p>Rich through his wisdom, noblest be the giver serving thee to-day: The man hath brought his hymn of praise.</p><p>These, Agni, these are helped by thee, who strong and active all their lives, O'ercome the malice of the foe, fight down the malice ofthe foe.</p><p>May Agni with his pointed blaze cast down each fierce devouring fiend May Agni win us wealth by war.</p><p>O active J&#257;tavedas, bring riches with store of hero sons: Slay thou the demons, O Most Wise.</p><p>Keep us, O J&#257;tavedas, from the troubling of the man of sin: Guard us thou Sage who knowest prayer.</p><p>Whatever sinner, Agni, brings oblations to procure our death, Save us from woe that he would work.</p><p>Drive from us with thy tongue, the man who doeth evil deeds, the mortal who would strike us dead.</p><p>Give shelter reaching far and wide to Bharadv&#257;ja, conquering Lord! Agni, send wealth most excellent.</p><p>May Agni subdue the V&#7771;tras,&#151;fain for riches, through the lord of song, Served with oblation, kindled, bright.</p><p>His Father's Father, shining in his Mother's everlasting side, Set on the seat of holy Law.</p><p>O active J&#257;tavedas, bring devotion that wins progeny, Agni, that i. May shine to Heaven.</p><p>O Child of Strength, to thee whose look is lovely we with dainty food, O Agni, have poured forth our songs.</p><p>To thee for shelter are we come, as to the shade from fervent heat Agni, who glitterest like gold.</p><p>Mighty as one who subdues with shafts, or like a bull with sharpened horn, Agni, thou breakest down the forts.</p><p>Whom, like an infant newly born, devourer, in their arms they bear, Men's Agni, skilled in holy rites.</p><p>Bear to the banquet of the Devas the Deva best finder-out of wealth, Let him he seated in his place.</p><p>In J&#257;tavedas kindle ye the dear guest who hath now appeared In a soft place, the homestead's Lord.</p><p>Harness, O Agni, O thou Deva, thy steeds which are most excellent: They bear thee as thy spirit wills.</p><p>Come hither, bring the Devas to us to taste the sacrificial feast, to drink the draught of Soma juice.</p><p>O Agni of the Bharatas, blaze high with everlasting might, Shine forth and gleam, Eternal One.</p><p>The mortal man who serves the Deva with banquet, and, bringing gifts at offering, lauds Agni, May well attract, with prayer and hands uplifted, the Monk of Heaven and Earth, true Offerer.</p><p>Agni, we bring thee, with our hymn, oblation fashioned in the heart. Let these be oxen unto thee, let these be bulls and kine to thee.</p><p>The Devas enkindle Agni, best slayer of V&#7771;tra, first in rank, the Mighty, One who brings us wealth and crushes down the R&#257;k&#7779;asas.</p>
