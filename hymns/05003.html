<h1>HYMN III. Agni.</h1>
<p>THOU at thy birth art Varu&#7751;</p>
</section>
<main>
<p>THOU at thy birth art Varu&#7751;a, O Agni; when thou art kindled thou becomest Mitra.</p><p>In thee, O Son of Strength, all Devas are centred. Indra art thou to man who brings oblation.</p><p>Aryaman art thou as regardeth maidens mysterious, is thy name, O Self-sustainer. As a kind friend with streams of milk they balm thee what time thou makest wife and lord one-minded.</p><p>The Devas deck their beauty for thy glory, yea, Soma! for thy birth fair, brightly-coloured. That which was fixed as Vi&#7779;&#7751;u's loftiest station&#151;therewith the secret of the Cows thou guardest.</p><p>Devas through thy glory, Deva who art so lovely! granting abundant gifts gained life immortal. As their own Monk have men established Agni; and serve him fain for praise from him who liveth.</p><p>There is no priest more skilled than thou in worship; none Self-sustainer pass thee in wisdom. The man within whose house as guest thou dwellest, by offering shall conquer mortals.</p><p>Aided by thee, O Agn. May we conquer through our oblation, fain for wealth, awakened: May we in battle, in the days&#146; assemblies, O Son of Strength, by riches conquer mortals.</p><p>He shall bring evil on the evil-plotter whoever turns against us sin and outrage. Destroy this calumny of him, O Agni, whoever injures us with double-dealing.</p><p>At this dawn's flushing, God! our ancient fathers served thee with offerings, making thee their envoy, when, Agni, to the store of wealth thou goest, a God enkindled with good things by mortals.</p><p>Save, thou who knowest, draw thy father near thee, who counts as thine own son, O Child of Power. O sapient Agni, when wilt thou regard us? When, skilled in holy Law, wilt thou direct us?</p><p>Adoring thee he gives thee many a title, when thou, Good Lord! acceptest this as Father. And doth not Agni, glad in strength of Godhead, gain splendid bliss when he hath waxen mighty?</p><p>Most Youthful Agni, verily thou bearest thy praiser safely over all his troubles. Thieves have been seen by us and open foemen: unknown have been the plottings of the wicked.</p><p>To thee these eulogies have been directed: or to the Vasu hath this sin been spoken. But this our Agni, flaming high, shall never yield us to calumny, to him who wrongs us.</p>
