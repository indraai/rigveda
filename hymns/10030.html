<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>As &#146;twere with swift exertion of the spirit, let the Monk speed to the celestial Waters, the glorious food of Varu&#7751;a and Mitra. To him who spreadeth far this laud I offer.</p><p>Adhvaryus, he ye ready with oblations, and come with longing to the longing Waters, Down on which looks the. purple-tinted Eagle. Pour ye that flowing wave this day, deft-handed.</p><p>Go to the reservoir, O ye Adhvaryus worship the Waters&#146; Child with your oblations.</p><p>A consecrated wave he now will give you, so press for him the Soma rich in sweetness.</p><p>He who shines bright in floods, unfed with fuel, whom sages worship at their offers: Give waters rich in sweets, Child of the Waters, even those which gave heroic might to Indra:</p><p>Those in which Soma joys and is delighted, as a young man with fair and pleasant damsels. Go thou unto those Waters, O Adhvaryu, and purify with herbs what thou infusest.</p><p>So maidens bow before the youthful gallant who comes with love to them who yearn to meet him. In heart accordant and in wish one-minded are the Adhvaryus and the heavenly Waters.</p><p>He who made room for you when fast imprisoned, who freed you from the mighty imprecation,&#151; Even to that Indra send the meath-rich current, the wave that gratifies the Devas, O Waters.</p><p>Send forth to him the meath-rich wave, O Rivers, which is your offspring and a well of sweetness, Oil-balmed, to be implored at offers. Ye wealthy Waters, hear mine invocation.</p><p>Send forth the rapture-giving wave, O Rivers, which Indra drinks, which sets the Twain in motion; The well that springeth from the clouds, desirous, that wandereth triple-formed, distilling transport.</p><p>These winding Streams which with their double current, like cattle-raiders, seek the lower pastures,&#151; Waters which dwell together, thrive together, Queens, Mothers of the world, these, &#7770;&#7779;i, honour.</p><p>Send forth our offering with holy worship send forth the hymn and prayer for gain of riches. For need of offering disclose the udder. Give gracious hearing to our call, O Waters.</p><p>For, wealthy Waters, ye control all treasures: ye bring auspicious intellect and Am&#7771;ta. Ye are the Queens of independent riches Sarasvat&#299; give full life to the singer!</p><p>When I behold the Waters coming hither, carrying with them milk and mcath and butter, bearing the well-pressed Soma juice to Indra, they harmonize in spirit with Adhvaryus.</p><p>Rich, they are come with wealth for living beings, O friends, Adhvaryus, seat them in their places. Seat them on holy grass, ye Soma-bringers in harmony with the Offspring of the Waters.</p><p>Now to this grass are come the longing Waters: the Pious Ones are seated at our worship. Adbvaryus, press the Soma juice for Indra so will the service of the Devas be easy.</p>
