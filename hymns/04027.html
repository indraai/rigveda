<h1>HYMN XXVII. The Falcon.</h1>
<p>I, as I lay within the womb, considered all generations of these Devas in order.</p>
</section>
<main>
<p>I, as I lay within the womb, considered all generations of these Devas in order.</p><p>A hundred iron fortresses confined me but forth I flew with rapid speed a Falcon.</p><p>Not at his own free pleasure did he bear me: he conquered with his strength and manly courage. Straightway the Bold One left the fiends behind him and passed the winds as he grew yet more mighty.</p><p>When with loud cry from Heaven down sped the Falcon, thence hasting like the wind he bore the Bold One. Then, wildly raging in his mind, the archer K&#7771;&#347;&#257;nu aimed and loosed the string to strike him.</p><p>The Falcon bore him from Heaven's lofty summit as the swift car of Indra's Friend bore Bhujyu. Then downward hither fell a flying feather of the Bird hasting forward in his journey.</p><p>And now let Indra accept the beaker, white, filled with milk, filled with the shining liquid; The best of sweet meath which the monks have offered: that Indra to his jo. May drink, the Hero, that h. May take and drink it to his rapture.</p>
