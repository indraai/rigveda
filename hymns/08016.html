<p>PRAISE Indra whom our songs must laud, sole Sovran of mankind, the Chief Most liberal who controlleth men.</p><p>In whom the hymns of praise delight, and all the glory-giving songs.</p><p>Like the floods' longing for the sea.</p><p>Him I invite with eulogy, best King, effective in the fight, Strong for the gain of mighty spoil.</p><p>Whose perfect ecstasies are wide, profound, victorious, and give joy in the field where heroes win.</p><p>Him, when the spoils of war are staked, men call to be their advocate: They who have Indra win the day.</p><p>Men honour him with stirring songs and magnify with solemn rites: Indra is he who giveth case.</p><p>Indra is priest and &#7770;&#7779;i, he is much invoked by many men, and mighty by his mighty powers.</p><p>Meet to be lauded and invoked, true Hero with his deeds of might, Victorious even when alone.</p><p>The men, the people magnify that Indra with their Slina. songs, with hymns and sacred eulogies</p><p>Him who advances them to wealth, sends light to lead them in the war, and quells their foemen in the fray.</p><p>May he, the saviour much-invoked. May Indra bear us in a ship Safely beyond all enemies.</p><p>As such, O Indra, honour us with gifts of booty, further us, and lead us to felicity.</p>
