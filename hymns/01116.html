<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>I TRIM like grass my song for the N&#257;satyas and send their lauds forth as the wind drives rain-clouds, who, in a chariot rapid as an arrow, brought to the youthful Vimada a consort.</p><p>Borne on by rapid steeds of mighty pinion, or proudly trusting in the Devas&#146; incitements.</p><p>That stallion ass of yours won, O N&#257;satyas, that thousand in the race, in Yama's contest.</p><p>Yea, A&#347;vins, as a dead man leaves his riches, Tugra left Bhujyu in the cloud of waters. Ye brought him back in animated vessels, traversing air, unwetted by the billows.</p><p>Bhujyu ye bore with winged things, N&#257;satyas, which for three nights, three days full swiftly travelled, to the sea's farther shore, the strand of ocean, in three cars, hundred-footed, with six horses.</p><p>Ye wrought that hero exploit in the ocean which giveth no support, or hold or station, What time ye carried Bhujyu to his dwelling, borne in a ship with hundred oars, O A&#347;vins.</p><p>The white horse which of old ye gave Agh&#257;&#347;va, A&#347;vins, a gift to be his wealth forever,&#151; Still to be praised is that your glorious present, still to be famed is the brave horse of Pedu.</p><p>O Heroes, ye gave wisdom to Kak&#7779;&#299;v&#257;n who sprang from Pajra's line, who sang your praises. Ye poured forth from the hoof of your strong charger a hundred jars of wine as from a strainer.</p><p>Ye warded off with cold the fire's fierce burning; food very rich in nourishment ye furnished. Atri, cast downward in the cavern, A&#347;vins ye brought, with all his people, forth to comfort.</p><p>Ye lifted up the well, O ye N&#257;satyas, and set the base on high to open downward. Streams flowed for folk of Gotama who thirsted, like rain to bring forth thousandfold abundance.</p><p>Ye from the old Cyav&#257;na, O N&#257;satyas, stripped, as &#146;twere mail, the skin upon his body, Lengthened his life when all had left him helpless, Dasras! and made him lord of youthful maidens.</p><p>Worthy of praise and worth the winning, Heroes, is that your favouring succour O N&#257;satyas, What time ye, knowing well his case, delivered Vandana from the pit like hidden treasure.</p><p>That mighty deed of yours, for gain, O Heroes, as thunder heraldeth the rain, I publish, when, by the horse's head, Atharvan's offspring Dadhyac made known to you the Soma's sweetness.</p><p>In the great rite the wise dame called, N&#257;satyas, you, Lords of many treasures, to assist her. Ye heard the weakling's wife, as &#146;twere an order, and gave to her a son Hira&#7751;yahasta.</p><p>Ye from the wolf's jaws, as ye stood together, set free the quail, O Heroes, O N&#257;satyas. Ye, Lords of many treasures, gave the poet his perfect vision as he mourned his trouble.</p><p>When in the time of night, in Khela's battle, a leg was severed like a wild bird's pinion, Straight ye gave Vi&#347;pal&#257; a leg of iron that she might move what time the conflict opened.</p><p>His father robbed &#7770;jr&#257;&#347;va of his eyesight who for the she-wolf slew a hundred wethers. Ye gave him eyes, N&#257;satyas, Wonder-Workers, Physicians, that he saw with sight uninjured.</p><p>The Daughter of the Sun your car ascended, first reaching as it were the goal with coursers. All Deities within their hearts assented, and ye, N&#257;satyas, are close linked with glory.</p><p>When to his house ye came, to Divod&#257;sa, hasting to Bharadv&#257;ja, O ye A&#347;vins, the car that came with you brought splendid riches: a porpoise and a bull were yoked together.</p><p>Ye, bringing wealth with rule, and life with offspring, life rich in noble heroes; O N&#257;satyas, Accordant came with strength to Jahnu's children who offered you thrice every day your portion.</p><p>Ye bore away at night by easy pathways J&#257;hu&#7779;a compassed round on every quarter, and, with your car that cleaves the toe asunder, N&#257;satyas never decaying! rent the mountains.</p><p>One morn ye strengthened Va&#347;a for the battle, to gather spoils that might be told in thousands. With Indra joined ye drove away misfortunes, yea foes of P&#7771;thu&#347;ravas, O ye mighty.</p><p>From the deep well ye raised on high the water, so that &#7770;catka's son, Sara, should drink it; And with your might, to help the weary &#346;ayu, ye made the barren cow yield milk, N&#257;satyas.</p><p>To Vi&#347;vaka, N&#257;satyas! son of K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a, the righteous man who sought your aid and praised you, Ye with your powers restored, like some lost creature, his son Vi&#7779;&#7751;&#257;p&#363; for his eyes to look on.</p><p>A&#347;vins, ye raised, like Soma in a ladle Rebha, who for ten days and ten nights, fettered. Had lain in cruel bonds, immersed and wounded, suffering sore affliction, in the waters.</p><p>1 have declared your wondrous deeds, O A&#347;vins. May this be mine, and many kine and heroes. May I, enjoying lengthened life, still seeing, enter old age as &#146;twere the house I live in.</p>
