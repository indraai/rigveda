<h1>RigVeda Hymn 05001</h1>

<main>
<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>Agni is wakened by the people's fuel to meet the Dawn who cometh like a milch-cow.</p><p>Like young trees shooting up on high their branches, his flames are rising to the vault of Heaven.</p><p>For worship of the Devas the Monk was wakened: at morning gracious Agni hath arisen. Kindled, his radiant might is made apparent, and the great Deity set free from darkness.</p><p>When he hath stirred the line of his attendants, with the pure milk pure Agni is anointed. The strength-bestowing gift is then made ready, which spread in front, with tongues, erect, he drinketh.</p><p>The spirits of the pious turn together to Agni, as the eyes of all to S&#363;rya. He, when both Dawns of different hues have borne him, springs up at daybreak as a strong white charger.</p><p>The noble One was born at days' beginning, laid red in colour mid the well-laid fuel. Yielding in every house his seven rich treasures, Agni is seated, Monk most skilled in worship.</p><p>Agni hath sat him down, a Monk most skilful, on a sweet-smelling place, his Mother's bosom. Young, faithful, sage, preeminent o&#146;er many, kindled among the folk whom he sustaineth.</p><p>This Singer excellent at offers, Agni the Monk, they glorify with homage. Him who spread out both worlds by Law Eternal they balm with oil, strong Steed who never faileth.</p><p>He, worshipful House-Friend, in his home is worshipped, our own auspicious guest, lauded by sages. That strength the Bull with thousand horns possesses. In might, O Agni, thou excellest others.</p><p>Thou quickly passest by all others, Agni, for him to whom thou hast appeared most lovely, Wondrously fair, adorable, effulgent, the guest of men, the darling of the people.</p><p>To thee, most Youthful God! to thee, O Agni from near and far the people bring their tribute. Mark well the prayer of him who best extols thee. Great, high, auspicious, Agni, is thy shelter.</p><p>Ascend to-day thy splendid car, O Agni, in splendour, with the Holy Ones around it. Knowing the paths by mid-air's spacious region bring hither Devas to feast on our oblation.</p><p>To him adorable, sage, strong and mighty we have sung forth our song of praise and homage. Gavisthira hath raised with prayer to Agni this laud far-reaching, like gold light to Heaven.</p>
