<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>AT the first shining of the earliest Mornings, in the Cow's home was born the Great Eternal.</p><p>Now shall the statutes of the Devas be valid. Great is the Devas&#146; supreme and sole dominion -</p><p>Let not the Devas here injure us, O Agni, nor Fathers of old time who know the region, Nor the sign set between two ancient dwellings. Great is the Devas&#146; supreme and sole dominion.</p><p>My wishes fly abroad to many places: I glance back to the ancient offers. Let us declare the truth when fire is kindled. Great is the Devas&#146; supreme and sole dominion.</p><p>King Universal, born to sundry quarters, extended through the wood be lies on couches. One Mother rests: another feeds the Infant. Great is the Devas&#146; supreme and sole dominion.</p><p>Lodged in old plants, he grows again in younger, swiftly within the newly-born and tender. Though they are unimpregned, he makes them fruitful. Great is the Devas&#146; supreme and sole dominion.</p><p>Now lying far away, Child of two Mothers, he wanders unrestrained, the single youngling. These are the laws of Varu&#7751;a and Mitra. Great is the Devas&#146; supreme and sole dominion.</p><p>Child of two Mothers, Monk, sole Lord in synods, he still precedes while resting as foundation. They who speak sweetly bring him sweet addresses. Great is the Devas&#146; supreme and sole dominion.</p><p>As to a friendly warrior when he battles, each thing that comes anear is seen to meet him. The hymn commingles with the cow's oblation. Great is the Devas&#146; supreme and sole dominion.</p><p>Deep within these the hoary envoy pierceth; mighty, he goeth to the realm of splendour, and looketh on us, clad in wondrous beauty. Great is the Devas&#146; supreme and sole dominion.</p><p>Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, the guardian, keeps the loftiest station, upholding dear, immortal dwelling-places. Agni knows well all these created beings. Great is the Devas&#146; supreme and sole dominion.</p><p>Ye, variant Pair, have made yourselves twin beauties: one of the Twain is dark, bright shines the other; And yet these two, the dark, the red, are Sisters. Great is the Devas&#146; supreme and sole dominion.</p><p>Where the two Cows, the Mother and the Daughter, meet and give suck yielding their lordly nectar, I praise them at the seat of law eternal. Great is the Devas&#146; supreme and sole dominion.</p><p>Loud hath she lowed, licking the other's youngling. On what world hath the Milch-cow laid her udder? This I&#7735;&#257; streameth with the milk of Order. Great is the Devas&#146; supreme and sole dominion.</p><p>Earth weareth beauties manifold: uplifted, licking her Calf of eighteen months, she standeth. Well-skilled I seek the seat of law eternal. Great is the Devas&#146; supreme and sole dominion.</p><p>Within a wondrous place the Twain are treasured: the one is manifest, the other hidden. One common pathway leads in two directions. Great is the Devas&#146; supreme and sole dominion.</p><p>Let the milch-kine that have no calves storm downward, yielding rich nectar, streaming, unexhausted, these who are ever new and fresh and youthful. Great is the Devas&#146; supreme and sole dominion.</p><p>What time the Bull bellows in other regions, another herd receives the genial moisture; For he is Bhaga, King, the Earth's Protector. Great is the Devas&#146; supreme and sole dominion.</p><p>Let us declare the Hero's wealth in horses, O all ye folk: of this the Devas have knowledge. Sixfold they bear him, or by fives are harnessed. Great is the Devas&#146; supreme and sole dominion.</p><p>Tva&#7779;&#7789;ar the Deva, the omniform. Creator, begets and feeds mankind in various manner. His, verily, arc all these living creatures. Great is the Devas&#146; supreme dominion.</p><p>The two great meeting Bowls hath he united: each of the Pair is laden with histreasure. The Hero is renowned for gathering riches. Great is the Devas&#146; supreme and sole dominion.</p><p>Yea, and on this our Earth the All-Sustainer dwells like a King with noble friends about him. In his protection heroes rest in safety. Great is the Cods' supreme and sole dominion.</p><p>Rich in their gifts for thee are herbs and waters, and Earth brings all her wealth for thee, O Indra, may we as friends of thine share goodly treasures. Great is the Devas&#146; supreme and sole dominion.</p>
