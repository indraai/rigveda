<h2>HYMN LIX. Indra-Agni.</h2>

<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>I WILL declare, while juices flow, the manly deeds that ye have done: Your Fathers, enemies of Devas, were smitten down, and, Indra-Agni, ye survive.</p><p>Thus, Indra-Agnip verily your greatness merits loftiest praise, Sprung from one common Father, brothers, twins are ye; your Mother is in every place.</p><p>These who delight in flowing juice, like fellow horses at their food, Indra and Agni, Devas armed with the thunderbolt, we call this day to come with help.</p><p>Indra and Agni, Friends of Law, served with rich gifts, your speech is kind To him who praises you while these libations flow: that man, O Devas, ye ne&#146;er consume.</p><p>What mortal understands, O Devas, Indra and Agni, this your way? One of you, yoking Steeds that move to every side, advances in your common car.</p><p>First, Indra-Agni, hath this Maid come footless unto those with feet.</p><p>Stretching her head and speaking loudly with her tongue, she hath gone downward thirty steps.</p><p>E&#146;en now, O Indra-Agni, men hold in their arms and stretch their bows. Desert us not in this great fray, in battles for the sake of kine.</p><p>The foeman's sinful enmities, Indra and Agni, vex me sore. Drive those who hate me far away, and keep them distant from the Sun.</p><p>Indra and Agni, yours are all the treasures of the heavens and Earth. Here give ye us the opulence that prospers every living man.</p><p>O Indra-Agni, who accept the laud, and hear us for our praise, Come near us, drawn by all our songs, to drink of this our Soma juice.</p>
