That bounteous man through food shall conquer faemen, and win him opulence and wealthy people.</p><p>May wealth which ye bestow in food and treasure on him who brings you gifts and offers, Wealth, Devas! which breaks the curse of those who vex us, be, Indra-Varu&#7751;a, e&#146;en our own possession.</p><p>So also, Indra-Varu&#7751;a. May our princes have riches swift to save, with Devas to guard them. They whose great might gives victory in battles, and their triumphant glory spreads with swiftness.</p><p>Indra. and Varu&#7751;a, Devas whom we are lauding, with your heroic glory. May we, who praise the strength of what is mighty, pass dangers, as with boats we cross the waters.</p><p>Now will I sing a dear and far-extending hymn to Varu&#7751;a the Deva, who, mighty Governor, Eternal, as with flame, illumines both wide worlds with majesty and power.</p><p>True to Law, Indra-Varu&#7751;a, your chariot cometh to the banquet of the Devas, to offering, as it were home, that y. May drink.</p><p>Indra and Varu&#7751;a, drink your fill, ye Heroes, of this invigorating sweetest hymn. This juice is shed on this trimmed grass be seated, and rejoice you.</p>
