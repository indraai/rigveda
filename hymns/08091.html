<p>LORD of the house, Sage, ever young, high power of life, O Agni, Deva, Thou givest to thy worshipper.</p><p>So with our song that prays and serves, attentive, Lord of spreading light, Agni, bring hitherward the Devas.</p><p>For, Ever-Youthful One, with thee, best Furtherer, as our ally, We overcome, to win the spoil.</p><p>As Aurva Bh&#7771;gu used, as Apnav&#257;na used, I call the pure Agni who clothes him with the sea.</p><p>1 call the Sage who sounds like wind, the Might that like Parjanya roars, Agni who clothes him with the sea.</p><p>As Indra's productive Power, as him who sends down bliss, I call Agni who clothes him with the sea.</p><p>Hither, for powerful kirship, I call Agni, him Who prospers you, most frequent at our solemn rites</p><p>That through this famed One's power, h. May stand by us even as Tva&#7779;&#7789;ar comes Unto the forms that must he shaped.</p><p>This Agni is the Lord supreme above all glories mid the Devas: May he come nigh to us with strength.</p><p>Here praise ye him the most renowned of all the ministering Monks, Agni, the Chief at offering;</p><p>Piercing, with purifying flame, enkindled in our homes, most high, Swiftest to hear from far away.</p><p>Sage, laud the Mighty One who wins the spoil of victory like a steed, and, Mitra like, unites the folk.</p><p>Still turning to their aim in thee, the oblation-bearer's sister hymns Have come to thee before the wind.</p><p>The waters find their place in him, for whom the threefold sacred grass Is spread unbound, unlimited.</p><p>The station of the Bounteous God hath, through his aid which none impair, a pleasant aspect like the Sun.</p><p>Blazing with splendour, Agni, Deva, through pious gifts of sacred oil. Bring thou the Devas and worship them.</p><p>The Devas as mothers brought thee forth, the Immortal Sage, O A&#7749;giras, the bearer of our gifts to Heaven.</p><p>Wise Agni, Devas established thee, the Seer, noblest messenger, as bearer of our sacred gifts.</p><p>No cow have I to call mine own, no axe at hand wherewith to work, Yet what is here I bring to thee.</p><p>O Agni, whatsoever be the fuel that we lay for thee, be pleased therewith, most Youthful God</p><p>That which the white-ant cats away, that over which the emmet crawls- May all of this be oil to thee.</p><p>When he enkindles Agni, man should with his heart attend the song: I with the monks have kindled him.</p>
