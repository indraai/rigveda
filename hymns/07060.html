<p>WHEN thou, O Sun, this day, arising sinless, shalt speak the truth to Varu&#7751;a and Mitra, O Aditi. May all the Deities love us, and thou, O Aryaman, while we are singing.</p><p>Looking on man, O Varu&#7751;a and Mitra, this Sun ascendeth up by both the pathways, Guardian of all things fixt, of all that moveth, beholding good and evil acts of mortals.</p><p>He from their home hath yoked the Seven gold Coursers who, dropping oil and fatness, carry S&#363;rya.</p><p>Yours, Varu&#7751;a and Mitra, he surveyeth the worlds and living creatures like a herdsman.</p><p>Your coursers rich in store of sweets have mounted: to the bright ocean S&#363;rya hath ascended, for whom the &#256;dityas make his pathway ready, Aryaman, Mitra, Varu&#7751;a, accordant.</p><p>For these, even Aryaman, Varu&#7751;a and Mitra, are the chastisers of all guile and falsehood. These, Aditi's Sons, infallible and mighty, have waxen in the home of law Eternal.</p><p>These, Mitra, Varu&#7751;a whom none deceiveth, with great power quicken even the fool to wisdom, and, wakening, moreover, thoughtful insight, lead it by easy paths o&#146;er grief and trouble.</p><p>They ever vigilant, with eyes that close not, caring for Heaven and Earth, lead on the thoughtless. Even in the river's bed there is a shallow. across this broad expans. May they conduct us.</p><p>When Aditi and Varu&#7751;a and Mitra, like guardians, give Sud&#257;s their friendly shelter, Granting him sons and lineal succession, let us not, bold ones! move the Devas to anger.</p><p>May he with ofierings purify the altar from any stains of Varu&#7751;a's reviler. Aryaman save us us all those who hate us: give room and freedom to Sud&#257;s, ye Mighty.</p><p>Hid from our eyes is their resplendent meeting: by their mysterious might they hold dominion. Heroes! we cry trembling in fear before you, even in the greatness of your power have mercy.</p><p>He who wins favour for his prayer by worship, that h. May gain him strength and highest riches, that good man's mind the Mighty Ones will follow: they have brought comfort to his spacious dwelling.</p><p>This priestly task, Devas! Varu&#7751;a and Mitra! hath been performed for you at offers. Convey us safely over every peril. Preserve us evermore, ye Devas, with blessings.</p>
