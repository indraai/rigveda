<h1>RigVeda Hymn 05034</h1>

<main>
<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>BOUNDLESS and wasting not, the heavenly food of Devas goes to the foeless One, doer of wondrous deeds.</p><p>Press out, make ready, offer gifts with special zeal to him whom many laud, accepter of the prayer.</p><p>He who filled full his belly with the Soma's juice, Indra, was delighted with the meath's sweet draught, when U&#347;an&#257;, that he might subdue the monstrous beast, gave him the mighty weapon with a thousand points.</p><p>Illustrious is the man whoever presseth out Soma for him in sunshine or in cloud and rain. The mighty Indra who is the sage's Friend advanceth more and more his beauteous progeny.</p><p>The Strong God doth not flee away from him whose sire, whose mother or whose brother he hath done to death. He, the Avenger, seeketh this man's offered gifts: this Deva, the source of riches, doth not flee from sin.</p><p>He seeks no enterprise with five or ten to aid, nor stays with him who pours no juice though prospering well. The Shaker conquers or subdues in this way or that, and to the pious gives a stable full of kine.</p><p>Exceeding strong in war he stays the chariot wheel, and, hating him who pours not, prospers him who pours. Indra, tamer of every man, as &#256;rya leads away the D&#257;sa at his will.</p><p>He gathers up for plunder all the niggard&#146;s gear: excellent wealth he gives to him who offers gifts. Not even in wide stronghol. May all the folk stand firm who have provoked to anger his surpassing might.</p><p>When Indra Indra hath marked two wealthy men fighting for beauteous cows with all their followers, He who stirs all things takes one as his close ally, and, Shaker, with his Heroes, sends the kine to him.</p><p>Agni! I laud the liberal Agnivesi, Satri the type and standard of the pious. May the collected waters yield him plenty, and his be powerful and bright dominion.</p>
