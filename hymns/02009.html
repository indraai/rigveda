<p>ACCUSTOMED to the Herald's place, the Herald hath seated him, bright, splendid, passing mighty, whose foresight keeps the Law from violation excellent, pure-tongued, bringing thousands, Agni.</p><p>Envoy art thou, protector from the foeman, strong Deva, thou leadest us to higher blessings.</p><p>Refulgent, be an ever-heedful keeper, Agni, for us and for our seed offspring.</p><p>May we adore thee in thy loftiest birthplace, and, with our praises, in thy lower station. The place whence thou issued forth I worship: to thee well kindled have they paid oblations.</p><p>Agni, best Monk, pay worship with oblation; quickly commend the gift to be presented; For thou art Lord of gathered wealth and treasure. of the bright song of praise thou art inventor.</p><p>The twofold opulence, O Wonder-Worker, of thee new-born each day never decreases. Enrich with food the man who lauds thee, Agni: make him the lord of wealth with noble offspring.</p><p>May he, benevolent with this fair aspect, best offerer, bring the Devas to bless us. Sure guardian, our protector from the foemen, shine, Agni, with thine affluence and splendour.</p>
