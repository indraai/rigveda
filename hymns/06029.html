<h1>HYMN XXIX Indra.</h1>
<p>YOUR men have followed Indra for his friendship, and for his loving-kindness glorified him.</p>

<p>YOUR men have followed Indra for his friendship, and for his loving-kindness glorified him.</p><p>For he bestows great wealth, the Thunder-wielder: worship him, Great and Kind, to win his favour.</p><p>Him to whose hand, men closely cling, and drivers stand on his golden chariot firmly stationed. With his firm arms he holds the reins; his Horses, the Stallions, are yoked ready for the journey.</p><p>Thy devotees embrace thy feet for glory. Bold, thunder-armed, rich, through thy strength, in guerdon, Robed in a garment fair as Heaven to look on, thou hast displayed thee like an active dancer.</p><p>That Soma when effused hath best consistence, for which the food is dressed and grain is mingled; By which the men who pray, extolling Indra chief favourites of Devas, recite their praises.</p><p>No limit of thy might hath been appointed, which by its greatness sundered Earth and Heaven. These the Prince filleth full with stron endeavour, driving, as &#146;twere, with help his flocks to waters.</p><p>So be the lofty Indra prompt to listen, Helper unaided, golden-visored Hero. Yea, s. May he, shown forth in might unequalled, smite down the many V&#7771;tras and the Dasyus.</p>
