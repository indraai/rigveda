<h1>HYMN LXXXV. S&#363;rya's Bridal.</h1>
<p>TRUTH is the base that bears the Earth;</p>
</section>
<main>
<p>TRUTH is the base that bears the Earth; by S&#363;rya are the heavens sustained.</p><p>By Law the &#256;dityas stand secure, and Soma holds his place in Heaven.</p><p>By Soma are the &#256;dityas strong, by Soma mighty is the Earth. Thus Soma in the midst of all these constellations hath his place.</p><p>One thinks, when they have brayed the plant, that he hath drunk the Soma's juice; Of him whom Brahmans truly know as Soma no on ever tastes.</p><p>Soma, secured by sheltering rules, guarded by hymns in Brhati, Thou standest listening to the stones none tastes of thee who dwells on Earth.</p><p>When they begin to drink thee then, thou swellest out again. V&#257;yu is Soma's guardian God. The Moon is that which shapes the years.</p><p>Raibhi was her dear bridal friend, and Narasamsi led her home. Lovely was S&#363;rya's robe: she came to that which Gatha had adorned.</p><p>Thought was the pillow of her couch, sight was the unguent for her eyes: Her treasury was Earth and Heaven.&#7817;hen S&#363;rya went unto her Lord.</p><p>Hymns were the cross-bars of the pole, Kurira-metre decked the car: The bridesmen were the A&#347;vin Pair Agni was leader of the train.</p><p>Soma was he who wooed the maid: the groomsmen were both A&#347;vins, when The Sun-God Indra bestowed his willing S&#363;rya on her Lord.</p><p>Her spirit was the bridal car; the covering thereof was Heaven: Bright were both Steers that drew it when S&#363;rya approached her husband's, home.</p><p>Thy Steers were steady, kept in place by holy verse and S&#257;ma-hymn: All car were thy two chariot wheels: thy path was tremulous in the sky,</p><p>Clean, as thou wentest, were thy wheels wind, was the axle fastened there. S&#363;rya, proceeding to her Lord, mounted a spirit-fashioried car.</p><p>The bridal pomp of S&#363;rya, which Indra started, moved along. In Magha days are oxen slain, in Arjuris they wed the bride.</p><p>When on your three-wheeled chariot, O A&#347;vins, ye came as wooers unto S&#363;rya's bridal, then all the Devas agreed to your proposal P&#363;&#7779;an as Son elected you as Fathers.</p><p>O ye Two Lords of lustre, then when ye to S&#363;rya's wooing came, Where was one chariot wheel of yours? Where stood ye for die Sire's command?</p><p>The Brahmans, by their seasons, know, O S&#363;rya, those two wheels of thine: One kept concealed, those only who are skilled in highest truths have learned.</p><p>To S&#363;rya and the Deities, to Mitra and to Varu&#7751;a. Who know aright the thing that is, this adoration have I paid.</p><p>By their own power these Twain in close succession move; They go as playing children round the offering. One of the Pair beholdeth all existing things; the other ordereth seasons and is born again.</p><p>He, born afresh, is new and new forever ensign of days he goes before the Mornings Coming, he orders f6r the Devas their portion. The Moon prolongs the days of our existence.</p><p>Mount this, all-shaped, gold-hued, with strong wheels, fashioned of Kimsuka and Salmali, light-rolling, Bound for the world of life immortal, S&#363;rya: make for thy lord a happy bridal journey.</p><p>Rise up from hence: this maiden hath a husband. I laud Visvavasu with hymns and homage. Seek in her father's home another fair one, and find the portion from of old assigned thee.</p><p>Rise up from hence, Visvavasu: with reverence we worship thee. Seek thou another willing maid, and with her husband leave the bride.</p><p>Straight in direction be the path:s, and thornless, whereon our fellows travel to the wooing. Let Aryaman and Bhaga lead us: perfect, O Devas, the union of the wife and husband.</p><p>Now from the noose of Varu&#7751;a I free thee, wherewith Most Blessed Indra hath bound thee. In Law's seat, to the world of virtuous action, I give thee up uninjured with thy consort.</p><p>Hence, and not thence, I send these free. I make thee softly fettered there. That, Bounteous Indra, sh. May live blest in her fortune and her sons.</p><p>Let P&#363;&#7779;an take thy hand and hence conduct thee. May the two A&#347;vins on their car transport thee. Go to the house to be the household's mistress and speak as lady ito thy gathered people.</p><p>Happy be thou and prosper witlh thy children here: be vigilant to rule thy household in this home. Closely unite thy body with this; man, thy lord. So shall ye, full of years, address your company.</p><p>Her hue is blue and red: the fienod who clingeth close is driven off. Well thrive the kinsmen of this bride the husband is bourid fast in bonds.</p><p>Give thou the woollen robe away: deal treasure to the Brahman monks. This female fiend hath got her feet, and as a wife attends her lord.</p><p>Unlovely is his body when it glistens with this wicked fiend, What time the husband wraps about his limbs the garment of his wife.</p><p>Consumptions, from her people, which follow the bride's resplendent train,&#151; These let the Holy Devas again bear to the place from which they came.</p><p>Let not the highway thieves who lie in ambush find the wedded pair. By pleasant ways let them escape the danger, and let foes depart.</p><p>Signs of good fortune mark the bride come all of you and look at her. Wish her prosperity, and then return unto your homes again.</p><p>Pungent is this, and bitter this, filled, as it were, with arrow-barbs, Empoisoned and&#7751;ot fit for use. The Brahman who knows S&#363;rya well deserves the garment of the bride.</p><p>The fringe, the cloth that decks her head, and then the triply parted robe,&#151; Behold the hues which S&#363;rya wears these doth the Brahman purify.</p><p>I take thy hand in mine for happy fortune that tho. Mayst reach old age with me thy husband. Devas, Aryaman, Bhaga, Indra, Purandhi, have given thee to be my household's mistress.</p><p>O P&#363;&#7779;an, send her on as most auspicious, her who shall be the sharer of my pleasures; Her who shall twine her loving arms about me, and welcome all my love and mine embraces.</p><p>For thee, with bridal train, they, first, escorted S&#363;rya to her home. Give to the husband in return, Agni, the wife with progeny.</p><p>Agni hath given the bride again with splendour and with ample life. Long lived be he who is her lord; a hundred autumns let him live.</p><p>Soma obtained her first of all; next the Gandharva was her lord. Agai was thy third husband: now one bornof woman is thy fourth.</p><p>Soma to the Gandharva, and to Agni the Gandharva gave: And Agni hath bestowed on me riches and sons and this my spouse.</p><p>Be ye not parted; dwell ye here reach the full time of human life. With sons and grandsons sport and play, rejoicing in your own abode.</p><p>May Praj&#257;pati bring children forth to us. May Aryaman adorn us till old age come nigh. Not inauspicious enter thou thy husband's house: bring blessing to our bipeds and our quadrupeds.</p><p>Not evil-eyed, no slayer of thy husband, bring weal to cattle, radiant, gentlehearted; Loving the Devas, delightful, bearing heroes, bring blessing to our quadrupeds and bipeds.</p><p>O Bounteous Indra, make this bride blest in her sons and fortunate. Vouchsafe to her ten sons, and make her husband the eleventh man.</p><p>Over thy husband's father and thy husband's mother bear full sway. Over the sister of thy lord, over his brothers rule supreme.</p><p>May the Universal Devas, s. May the Waters join our hearts. May M&#257;tari&#347;van, Dh&#257;tar, and Destri together bind us close.</p>
