<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>BRISK, at the place of I·∏∑ƒÅ, hymned by men who wake, our own familiar Friend is kindled in the house; Hotar of all oblation, worthy of our choice, Lord, beaming, trusty friend to one who loveth him.</p><p>He, excellent in glory, guest in every house, finds like a swift-winged bird a home in every tree.</p><p>Benevolent to men, he scorns no living man: Friend to the tribes of men he dwells with every tribe.</p><p>Most sage with insight, passing skilful with thy powers art thou, O Agni, wise with wisdom, knowing all. As Vasu, thou alone art Lord of all good things, of all the treasures that the heavens and Earth produce.</p><p>Foreknowing well, O Agni, thou in I·∏∑ƒÅ's place hast occupied thy regular station balmed with oil. Marked are thy comings like the comings of the Dawns, the rays of him who shineth spotless as the Sun.</p><p>Thy glories are, as lightnings from the rainy cloud, marked, many-hued, like heralds of the Dawns‚Äô approach, when, loosed to wander over plants and forest trees, thou crammest by thyself thy food into thy mouth.</p><p>Him, duly coming as their germ, have plants received: this Agni have maternal Waters brought to life. So in like manner do the forest trees and plants bear him within them and produce him evermore.</p><p>When, sped and urged by wind, thou spreadest thee abroad, swift piercing through thy food according to thy will, Thy never-ceasing blazes, longing to consume, like men on chariots, Agni, strive on every side.</p><p>Agni, the Hotar-priest who fills the assembly full, Waker of knowledge, chief Controller of the thought. Him, yea, none other than thyself, doth man elect at sacrificial offerings great and small alike.</p><p>Here, Agni, the arrangers, those attached to thee, elect thee as their Monk in sacred gatherings, when men with strewn clipt grass and sacrificial gifts offer thee entertainment, piously inclined.</p><p>Thine is the Herald's task and Cleanser's duly timed; Leader art thou, and Kindler for the pious man. Thou art Director, thou the ministering Monk, Lord and Master in our home.</p><p>When mortal man presents to thee Immortal Deva, Agni, his fuel or his sacrificial gift, then thou art his Adhvaryu, Hotar, messenger, callest the Devas and orderest the offering.</p><p>From us these hymns in concert have gone forth to him, these. holy words, these ·πöcas, songs and eulogies, Eager for wealth, to JƒÅtavedas fain for wealth: when they have waxen strong they please their Strengthener.</p><p>This newest eulogy will I speak forth to him, the Ancient One who loves it. May he hear our voice. May it come near his heart and make it stir with love, as a fond well-dressed matron clings about her lord.</p><p>He in whom horses, bulls, oxen, and barren cows, and rams, when duly set apart, are offered up. To Agni, Soma-sprinkled, drinker of sweet juice, Disposer, with my heart I bring a fair hymn forth.</p><p>Into thy mouth is poured the offering, Agni, as Soma into cup, oil into ladle. Vouchsafe us wealth. strength-winning, blest with heroes, wealth lofty, praised by men, and full of splendour.</p>
