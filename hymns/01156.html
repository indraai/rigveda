<p>FAR-SHINING, widely famed, going thy wonted way, fed with the oil, be helpful. Mitra-like, to us.</p><p>So, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, e&#146;en the wise must swell thy song of praise, and he who hath oblations pay thee solemn rites.</p><p>He who brings gifts to him the Ancient and the Last, to Vi&#7779;&#7751;u who ordains, together with his Spouse, who tells the lofty birth of him the Lofty One, shall verily surpass in glory e&#146;en his peer.</p><p>Him have ye satisfied, singers, as well as ye know, primeval germ of Order even from his birth. Ye, knowing e&#146;en his name, have told it forth. May we, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, enjoy the grace of thee the Mighty One.</p><p>The Sovran Varu&#7751;a and both the A&#347;vins wait on this the will of him who guides the Marut host. Vi&#7779;&#7751;u hath power supreme and might that finds the day, and with his Friend unbars the stable of the kine.</p><p>Even he the Heavenly One who came for fellowship, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u to Indra, godly to the godlier, who Maker, throned in three worlds, helps the &#256;ryan man, and gives the worshipper his share of Holy Law.</p>
