<h2>HYMN LXVII. B&#7771;haspati.</h2>

<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>THIS holy hymn, sublime and sevenheaded, sprung from eternal Law, our sire discovered.</p><p>Ayasya, friend of all men, hath engendered the fourth hymn as he sang his laud to Indra.</p><p>Thinking aright, praising eternal Order, the sons of Devas the Devas, those heroes, A&#7749;girases, holding the rank of sages, first honoured offering's holy statute.</p><p>Girt by his friends who cried with swanlike voices, bursting the stony barriers of the prison, B&#7771;haspati spake in thunder to the cattle, and uttered praise and song when he had found them.</p><p>Apart from one, away from two above him, he drave the kine that stood in bonds of falsehood. B&#7771;haspati, seeking light amid the darkness, drave forth the bright cows: three he made apparent.</p><p>When he had cleft the lairs and western castle, he cut off three from him who held the waters. B&#7771;haspati discovered, while he thundered like Devas, the dawn, the Sun, the cow, the lightning.</p><p>As with a hand, so with his roaring Indra cleft Vala through, the guardian of the cattle. Seeking the milk-draught with sweatshining comrades he stole the Pa&#7751;i's kine and left him weeping.</p><p>He with bright faithful Friends, winners of booty, hath rent the milker of the cows asunder. B&#7771;haspati with wild boars strong and mighty, sweating with heat, hath gained a rich possession.</p><p>They, longing for the kine, with faithful spirit incited with their hymns the Lord of cattle. B&#7771;haspati freed the radiant cows with comrades self-yoked, averting shame from one another.</p><p>In our assembly with auspicious praises exalting him who roareth like a lion, Maywe, in every fight where heroes conquer, rejoice in strong B&#7771;haspati the Victor.</p><p>When he had won him every sort of booty and gone to Heaven and its most lofty mansions, Men praised B&#7771;haspati the Mighty, bringing the light within their mouths from sundry places.</p><p>Fulfil the prayer that begs for vital vigour: aid in your wonted manner even the humble. Let all our foes be turned and driven backward. Hear this, O Heaven and Earth, ye All-producers.</p><p>Indra with mighty strength cleft asunder the head of Arbuda the watery monster, Slain Ahi, and set free the Seven Rivers. O Heaven and Earth, with all the Devas protect us.</p>
