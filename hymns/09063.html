<p>POUR hitherward, O Soma, wealth in thousands and heroic strength, and keep renown secure for us.</p><p>Thou makest food and vigour swell for Indra, best of gladdeners! Within the cups thou seatest thee.</p><p>For Indra and for Vi&#7779;&#7751;u poured, Soma hath flowed into the jar: May V&#257;yu find it rich in sweets.</p><p>These Somas swift and brown of hue, in stream of solemn offering Have flowed through twisted obstacles,</p><p>Performing every noble work, active, augmenting Indra's strength, Driving away the godless ones.</p><p>Brown Soma-drops, effused that seek Indra, to their appropriate place Flow through the region hitherward.</p><p>Flow onward with that stream of thine wherewith thou gavest S&#363;rya light, Urging on waters good to men.</p><p>He, Pavamana, high o&#146;er man yoked the Sun's courser Eta&#347;a To travel through the realm of air.</p><p>And those ten Coursers, tawny-hued, he harnessed that the Sun might come Indu, he said, is Indra's self.</p><p>Hence, singers, pour the gladdeningjuice to V&#257;yu and to Indra, pour The drops upon the fleecy cloth.</p><p>O Indu, find wealth for us not to be assailed, Wealth which the foema. May not win.</p><p>Send riches hither with thy stream in thousands, both of steeds and kine, Send spoil of war and high renown.</p><p>Soma the Deva, expressed with stones, like S&#363;rya, floweth on his way, Pouring the juice within the jar.</p><p>These brilliant drops have poured for us, in stream of solemn offering, worshipful laws and strength in kine.</p><p>Over the cleansing sieve have flowed the Somas, blent with curdled milk, Effused for Indra Thunder-armed.</p><p>Soma, do thou most rich in sweets, a gladdening drink most dear to Devas, Flow to the sieve to bring us wealth.</p><p>For Indra, living men adorn the Tawny Courser in the streams, Indu, the giver of delight.</p><p>Pour for us, Soma, wealth in gold, in horses and heroic sons, Bring hither strength in herds of kine.</p><p>For Indra pour ye on the fleece him very sweet to taste, who longs.</p><p>For battle as it were in war.</p><p>The singers, seeking help, adorn the Sage who must be decked with songs: Loud bellowing the Steer comes on,</p><p>The singers with their thoughts and hymns have, in the stream of offering, Caused Soma, active Steer, to roar.</p><p>Deva, working with mankind, flow on; to Indra go thy gladdening juice: To V&#257;yu mount as Law commands</p><p>O Soma, Pavamana, thou pourest out wealth that brings renown: Enter the lake, as one we love.</p><p>Soma thou flowest chasing foes and bringing wisdom and delight: Drive off the folk who love not Devas.</p><p>The Pavamanas have been poured, the brilliant drops of Soma juice, for holy lore of every kind.</p><p>The Pavamanas have been shed, the beautiful swift Soma-drops, Driving all enemies afar.</p><p>From, Heaven, from out the Firmament, hath Pavamana been effused Upon the summit of the Earth.</p><p>O Soma, Indu, very wise, drive, being purified, with thy stream All foes, all R&#257;k&#7779;asas away.</p><p>Driving the R&#257;k&#7779;asas afar, O Soma, bellowing, pour for us Most excellent and splendid strength.</p><p>Soma, do thou secure for us the treasures of the earih and Heaven, Indu, all boons to be desired.</p>
