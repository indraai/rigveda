<div class="box hymn"><p>THOUGH, Indra, thou art called by men eastward and westward, north and south, Thou chiefly art with ƒÄnava and Turva≈õa, brave Champion I urged by men to Come.</p><p>Or, Indra, when with Ruma, Ru≈õama, ≈öyƒÅvaka, and K·πõpa thou rejoicest thee, Still do the Ka·πávas, bringing praises, with their prayers, O Indra, draw thee hither: come.</p><p>Even as the wild-bull, when he thirsts, goes to the desert's watery pool, Come hither quickly both at morning and at eve, and with the Ka·πávas drink thy fill.</p><p>May the drops gladden thee, rich Indra, and obtain bounty for him who pours the juice.</p><p>Soma pressed in the mortar didst thou take and drink, and hence hast won surpassing might.</p><p>With mightier strength he conquered strength, with energy he crushed their wrath. O Indra, Strong in youth, all those who sought the fray bent and bowed down to thee like trees.</p><p>He who wins promise of thine aid goes girt as with a thousand mighty men of war. He makes his son preeminent in hero might: he serves with reverential prayer.</p><p>With thee, the Mighty, for our Friend, we will not fear or feel fatigue. May we see Turva≈õa and Yadu: thy great deed, O Hero, must be glorified.</p><p>On his left hip the Hero hath reclined himself: the proffered feast offends him not. The milk is blended with the honey of the bee: quickly come hither, baste, and drink.</p><p>Indra, thy friend is fair of form and rich in horses, cars, and kine. He evermore hath food accompanied by wealth, and radiant joins the company.</p><p>Come like a thirsty antelope to the drinking-place: drink Soma to thy heart's desire. Raining it down, O Indra, day after day, thou gainest thy surpassing might.</p><p>Monk, let the Soma juice flow forth, for Indra longs to drink thereof. He even now hath yoked his vigorous Bay Steeds: hath come near.</p><p>The man with whom thou fillcst thee with Soma deems himself a pious worshipper. This thine appropriate food is here poured out for thee: come, hasten forward. drink of it,</p><p>Press out the Soma juice, ye monks, for Indra borne upon his car. The pressing-stones speak loud of Indra, while they shed the juice which, offered, honours him.</p><p>To the brown juic. May his dear vigorous Bay Steeds bring Indra, to our holy task. Hither let thy Car-steeds who seek the offering bring thee to our water-offerings.</p><p>P≈´·π£an, the Lord of ample wealth, for firm alliance we elect. May he with wisdom, Indra! Looser! Much-invoked! aid us to riches and to seed.</p><p>Sharpen us like a razor in the barber's hands: send riches thou who settest free. Easy to find with thee are treasures of the Dawn for mortal man whom thou dost speed.</p><p>P≈´·π£an, I long to win thy love, I long to praise thee, Radiant Deva. Excellent Lord, ‚Äôtis strange tome, no wish have I to sing the psalm that Pajra sings.</p><p>My kine, O Radiant Deva, seek pasture where they will, my during wealth, Immortal One. Be our protector, P≈´·π£an! be, most liberal Lord, propitious to our gathering strength.</p><p>Rich was the gift Kurunga gave, a hundred steeds at morning rites. Among the gifts of Turva≈õas we thought of him, the opulent, the splendid King.</p><p>What by his morning songs Ka·πáva, the powerful, hath, with the Priyamedhas, gained-</p><p>The herds of sixty thousand pure and spotless kine, have I, the ·πö·π£i, driven away.</p><p>The very trees were joyful at my coming: kine they obtained in plenty, steeds in plenty.</p>
