<div class="box hymn"><p>SWIFT, rapidly striking, like a bull who sharpens his horns, terrific, stirring up the people, with eyes that close not, bellowing, Sole Hero, Indra. subdued at once a hundred armies.</p><p>With him loud-roaring, ever watchful, Victor, bold, hard to overthrow, Rouser of battle, Indra. the Strong, whose hand bears arrows, conquer, ye warriors, now, now vanquish in the combat.</p><p>He rules with those who carry shafts and quivers, Indra who with his band rings hosts together, Foe-conquering, strong of arm, Soma, with mighty bow, shooting with well-laid arrows.</p><p>Soma, fly with thy chariot hither, slayer of demons, driving off our foemen.</p><p>Be thou protector of our cars, destroyer, victor in battle, breaker-up of armies.</p><p>Conspicuous by thy strength, firm, foremost fighter, mighty and fierce, victorious, all-subduing, the Son of Conquest, passing men and heroes, kine-winner, mount thy conquering car, O Indra.</p><p>Cleaver of stalls, kine-winner, armed with thunder, who quells an army and with might destroys it.- Follow him, brothers! quit yourselves like heroes, and like this Indra show your zeal and courage.</p><p>Piercing the cow-stalls with surpassing vigour, Indra, the pitiless Hero, wild with anger, Victor in fight, unshaken and resistless,may he protect our armies in our battles.</p><p>Indra guide these: Soma precede them, the guerdon, and the offering, and Soma; And let the banded Devas march in forefront of heavenly hosts that conquer and demolish.</p><p>Ours be the potent host of mighty Indra, King Indra, and Devas, and Ādityas. Uplifted is the shout of Devas who conquer high-minded Devas who cause the worlds to tremble.</p><p>Bristle thou up, O Indra, our weapons: excite the spirits of my warring heroes. Urge on the strong steeds' might, O Indra, and let the din of conquering cars go upward.</p><p>May Indra aid us when our flags are gathered: victorious be the arrows of our army. May our brave men of war prevail in battle. Ye Devas, protect us in the shout of onset.</p><p>Bewildering the senses of our foemen, seize thou their bodies and depart, O Apva. Attack them, set their hearts on fire and burn them: so let our foes abide in utter darkness.</p><p>Advance, O heroes, win the day. May Indra be your sure defence. Exceeding mighty be your arms, that non. May wound or injure you.</p>
