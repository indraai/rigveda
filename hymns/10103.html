Uplifted is the shout of Devas who conquer high-minded Devas who cause the worlds to tremble.</p><p>Bristle thou up, O Indra, our weapons: excite the spirits of my warring heroes. Urge on the strong steeds' might, O V&#7771;tra-slayer, and let the din of conquering cars go upward.</p><p>May Indra aid us when our flags are gathered: victorious be the arrows of our army. May our brave men of war prevail in battle. Ye Devas, protect us in the shout of onset.</p><p>Bewildering the senses of our foemen, seize thou their bodies and depart, O Apva. Attack them, set their hearts on fire and burn them: so let our foes abide in utter darkness.</p><p>Advance, O heroes, win the day. May Indra be your sure defence. Exceeding mighty be your arms, that non. May wound or injure you.</p>
