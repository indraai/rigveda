<p>THE welcome speaker in the storm of battle uttered with might this prayer to win the A&#347;vins, when the most liberal Deva, for Paktha, rescued his parents, and assailed the seven Hotras.</p><p>Cyav&#257;na, purposing deceptive presents, with all ingredients, made the altar ready.</p><p>Most sweet-voiced T&#363;rvay&#257;&#7751;a poured oblations like floods of widely fertilizing water.</p><p>To his oblations, swift as thought, ye hurried, and welcomed eagerly the prayers he offered. With arrows in his hand the Very Mighty forced from him all obedience of a servant.</p><p>I call on you the Sons of Devas, the A&#347;vins, that a dark cow to my red kine be added. Enjoy my offering, come to my offerings contented, not deceiving expectation. '</p><p>Membrum suum virile, quod vrotentum fuerat, mas ille retraxit. Rursus illud quod in juvenem filiam sublatum fuerat, non aggressurus, ad se rerahit.</p><p>Quum jam in medio connessu, semiperfecto opere, amorem in puellam pater impleverat, ambo discedentes seminis paulum in terrae superficiem sacrorum sede effusum emiserunt.</p><p>Quum pater suam nilam adiverat, cum e&#257; congressus suum semen supra progenuerunt, et Vastoshpatim, legum sacrarum custodem, formaverunt.</p><p>Ille tauro similis spumam in certamine jactavit, tunc discedens pusillaximis huc profectus est. Quasi dextro pede claudus processit, "inutiles fuerunt illi mei complexus," ita locutus.</p><p>'The fire, burning the people, does not approach quickly (by day): the naked (<i>R&#257;k&#7779;asas</i> approach) not Agni by night; the giver of fuel, and the giver of food, he, the upholder (of the rite), is born, overcoming enemies by his might.'</p><p>Uttering praise to suit the rite Navagvas came speedily to win the damsel's friendship. They who approached the twice-strong stable's keeper, meedless would milk the rocks that naught had shaken.</p><p>Swift was new friendship with the maid they quickly accepted it as genuine seed and bounty. Milk which the cow Sabardugh&#257; had yielded was the bright heritage which to thee they offered.</p><p>When afterwards they woke and missed the cattle, the speaker thus in joyful mood addressed them: Matchless are singers through the Vasu's nature; he bringeth them all food and all possessions.</p><p>His followers then who dwelt in sundry places came and desired too subdue the son of N&#7771;&#7779;ad. Resistless foe, be found the hidden treasure of &#346;u&#7779;&#7751;a multiplied in numerous offspring.</p><p>Thou, called Effulgence, in whose threefold dwelling, as in the light of Heavens are sitting, Thou who art called Agni or J&#257;tavedas, Monk, hear us, guileless Monk of holy worship.</p><p>And, Indra, bring, that . May laud and serve them, those Two resplendent glorious N&#257;satyas, Blithe, bounteous, man-like, to the offeringr, honoured among our men with offered offerings.</p><p>This King is praised and honoured as Ordainer: himself the bridge, the Sage speeds o&#146;er the waters. He hath stirred up Kak&#7779;&#299;v&#257;n, stirred up Agni, as the steed's swift wheel drives the felly onward.</p><p>Vaitarana, doubly kinsman, offerer, shall milk the cow who ne&#146;er hath calved, Sabardhu, when I encompass Varu&#7751;a and Mitra with lauds, and Aryaman in safest shelter.</p><p>Their kin, the Prince in Heaven, thy nearest kinsman, turning his thought to thee thus speaks in kindness: This is our highest bond: I am his offspring. How many others came ere I succeeded?</p><p>Here is my kinship, here the place I dwell in: these are my Devas; I in full strength am present. Twice-born am I, the first-born Son of Order: the Cow milked this when first she had her being.</p><p>So mid these tribes he rests, the friendly envoy, borne on two paths, refulgent Lord of fuel. When, like a line, the Babe springs up erectly, his Mother straight hath borne him strong to bless us.</p><p>Then went the milch-kine forth to please the damsel, and for the good of every man that liveth. Hear us, O wealthy Lord; begin our worship. Thou hast grown mighty through &#256;&#347;vaghna's virtues.</p><p>And take thou notice of us also, Indra, for ample riches, King whose arm wields thunder! Protect our wealthy nobles, guard our princes unmenaced near thee, Lord of Tawny Coursers.</p><p>When he goes forth, ye Pair of Kings, for booty, speeding to war and praise to please the singer,&#151; I was the dearest sage of those about him,&#151;let him lead these away and bring them safely.</p><p>Now for this noble man's support and comfort, singing with easy voice we thus implore thee: Impetuous be his son and fleet his courser: an. May I be his priest to win him glory.</p><p>If, for our strength, the Monk with adoration to win your friendship made the laud accepted, that laud shall be a branching road to virtue forevery one to whom the songs are suited.</p><p>Glorified thus, with holy hymns and homage:&#151;Of noble race, with Waters, God-attended&#151; May he enrich us for our meditations and praises: now can the cow be milked; the path is open.</p><p>Be to us, then, ye Devas who merit worship, be ye of one accord our strong protection, who went on various ways and brought us vigour, ye who are undeceivable explorers.</p>
