<h1>HYMN CVIII. Indra-Agni.</h1>
<p>ON that most wondrous car of yours, O Indra and Agni, which looks round on all things living, Take ye your stand and come to us together, and drink libations of the flowing Soma.</p>

<p>ON that most wondrous car of yours, O Indra and Agni, which looks round on all things living, Take ye your stand and come to us together, and drink libations of the flowing Soma.</p><p>As vast as all this world is in its compass, deep as it is, with its far-stretching surface, So let this Soma be, Indra and Agni, made for your drinking till your soul be sated.</p><p>For ye have won a blessed name together: yea, with one aim ye strove, O V&#7771;tra-slayers.</p><p>So Indra-Agni, seated here together, pour in, ye Mighty Ones, the mighty Soma.</p><p>Both stand adorned, when fires are duly kindled, spreading the sacred grass, with lifted ladles. Drawn by strong Soma juice poured forth around us, come, Indra-Agni, and display your favour.</p><p>The brave deeds ye have done, Indra and Agni, the forms ye have displayed and mighty exploits, the ancient and auspicious bonds of friendship,&#151;for sake of these drink of the flowing Soma.</p><p>As first I said when choosing you, in battle we must contend with Devass for this Soma. So came ye unto this my true conviction, and drank libations of the flowing Soma.</p><p>If in your dwelling, or with prince or Brahman, ye, Indra-Agni, Holy Ones, rejoice you, Even from thence, ye mighty Lords, come hither, and drink libation of the flowing Soma.</p><p>If with, the Yadus, Turva&#347;as, ye sojourn, with Druhyus, Anus, P&#363;rus, Indra-Agni! Even from thence, ye mighty Lords, come hither, and drink libations of the flowing Soma.</p><p>Whether, O Indra-Agni, ye be dwelling in lowest Earth, in central, or in highest. Even from thence, ye mighty Lords, come hither, and drink libations of the flowing Soma.</p><p>Whether, O Indra-Agni, ye be dwelling in highest Earth, in central, or in lowest, Even from thence, ye mighty Lords, come hither, and drink libations of the flowing Soma.</p><p>Whether ye be in Heaven, O Indra-Agni, on Earth, on mountains, in the herbs, or waters, Even from thence, ye mighty Lords, come hither, and drink libations of the flowing Soma.</p><p>If, when the Sun to the mid-Heaven hath mounted, ye take delight in food, O Indra-Agni, Even from thence, ye mighty Lords, come hither, and drink libations of the flowing Soma.</p><p>Thus having drunk your fill of our libation, win us all kinds of wealth, Indra and Agni. This prayer of our. May Varu&#7751;a grant, and Mitra, and Aditi and Sindhu, Earth and Heaven.</p>
