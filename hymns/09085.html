<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>FLOW on to Indra, Soma, carefully effused: let sickness stay afar together with the fiends.</p><p>Let not the double-tongued delight them with thy juice. here be thy flowing drops laden with opulence.</p><p>O Indu, urge us forward in the fight thou art the vigour of the Devas, the well-loved drink. Smite thou our enemies who raise the shout of joy: Indra, drink Soma juice, and drive away our foes.</p><p>Unharmed, best Cheerer O Indu, flowest on: thou, even thou thyself, art Indra's noblest food. Full many a wise man lifts to thee the song of praise, and hails thee with a kiss as Sovran of this world.</p><p>Wondrous, with hundred streams, hymned in a thousand songs, indu pours out for Indra his delightrul meath. Winning us land and waters, flow thou hitherward: Rainer of bounties, Soma, make broad way for us.</p><p>Roaring within the beaker thou art balmed with milk: thou passest through the fleecy filter all at once. Carefully cleansed and decked like a prizewinning steed, O Soma, thou hast flowed down within Indra's throat.</p><p>Flow onward sweet of flavour for the Heavenly Race, for Indra sweet, whose name is easily invoked: Flow sweet for Mitra, Indra, and Soma, rich in meath, inviolable for Soma.</p><p>Ten rapid fingers deck the Courser in the jar: with hymns the holy singers send their voices forth. The filtering juices hasten to their eulogy, the drops that gladden find their way to Indra's heart.</p><p>While thou art purified pour on us hero strength, great, far-extended shelter, spacious pasturage. Let no oppression master this our holy work. May we, O Indu, gain all opulence through thee.</p><p>The Steer who sees afar hath risen above the sky: the Sage hath caused the lights of Heaven to give their shine. The. King is passing through the filter with a roar: they drain the milk of Heaven from him who looks on men.</p><p>High in the vault of Heaven, unceasing, honey-tongued, the Loving Ones drain out the mountain-haunting Steer. The drop that hath grown great in waters, in the lake meath-rich, in the stream's wave and in the cleansing sieve.</p><p>The Loving Ones besought with many voices the Eagle who had flown away to Heaven. Hymns kiss the Youngling worthy of laudation, resting on Earth, the Bird of golden colour.</p><p>High to Heaven's vault hath the Gandharva risen, beholding all his varied forms and figures. His ray hath shone abroad with gleaming splendour: pure, he hath lighted both the worlds, the Parents.</p>
