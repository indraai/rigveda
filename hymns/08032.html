<div class="box hymn"><p>KANVAS, tell forth with song the deeds of Indra, the Impetuous, Wrought in the Soma's wild delight.</p><p>Strong Deva, he slew Anarsani, Srbinda, Pipru, and the fiend, AhÄ«Å›uva, and loosed the floods.</p><p>Thou broughtest down the dwelling-place, the height of lofty Arbuda.</p><p>That exploit, Indra, must be famed.</p><p>Bold, to your famous Soma I call the fair-visored Deva for aid, Down like a torrent from the hill.</p><p>Rejoicing in the Soma-draughts. Hero, burst open, like a fort, the stall of horses and of kine.</p><p>If my libation gladdens, if thou takest pleasure in my laud, Come with thy Godhead from afar.</p><p>O Indra, Lover of the Song, the singers of thy praise are we: O Soma-drinker, quicken us.</p><p>And, taking thy delight with us bring us still undiminished food: Great is thy wealth, O Indra.</p><p>Make thou us rich in herds of kine, in steeds, in gold: let us exert Our strength in sacrificial gifts.</p><p>Let us call him to aid whose hands stretch far, to whom high laud is due. Who worketh well to assist us.</p><p>He, Åšatakratu, even in fight acts as a Vá¹›tra-slayer s,till: He gives his worshippers much wealth.</p><p>May he, this A;akra, strengthen us, Boon Deva who satisfies our needs, Indra, with all lhis saving helps.</p><p>To him, the mighty stream of wealth, we's rescuing Friend, to Indra sing your song of praise;</p><p>Who bringeth what is great and firm, who winneth glory in his wars, Lord of vast wealth through power and might.</p><p>There liveth none to cheek or stay his energies and gracious deeds: None who can say. He giveth not.</p><p>No debt is due by Brahmans now, by active men who press the juice: Well hath each Soma-draught been paid.</p><p>Sing ye to him who must be praised, say lauds to him who must be praised, Bring prayer to him who must be praised.</p><p>May be, unchecked, strong, meet for praise, bring hundreds, thousands forth to light, Indra who aids the worshipper.</p><p>Go with thy Deva-like nature forth, go where the folk are calling thee: Drink, Indra, of the drops we pour.</p><p>Drink milky draughts which are thine own, this too which was with Tugrya once, This is it, Indra, that is thine.</p><p>Pass him who psours libations out in angry mood or after sin: Here drink the juice we offer thee.</p><p>Over the three great distances, past the Five Peoples go thy way, O Indra, noticing our voice.</p><p>Send forth thy ray like SÅ«rya: let my songs attract thee hitherward, like waters gathering to the vale.</p><p>Now to the Hero fair of cheek, Adhvaryu, pour the Soma forth: Bring of the juice that h. May drink</p><p>Who cleft the water-cloud in twain, loosed rivers for their downward flow, and set the ripe milk in the kine.</p><p>He, meet for praise, slew Vá¹›tra, slew AhÄ«Å›uva, Urnavabha's son, and pierced th:rough Arbuda with frost.</p><p>To him your matchless Mighty One, unconquerable Conqueror, Sing forth the prayer which Devas have given:</p><p>Indra, who in the wild delight of Soma juice considers here All holy Laws among the Devas.</p><p>Hither let these thy Bays who share thy banquet, Steeds with golden manes, Convey thee to the feast prepared.</p><p>Hither, O thou whom many laud, the Bays whom Priyamedha praised, Shall bring thee to the Soma-draught.</p>
