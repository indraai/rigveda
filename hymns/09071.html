<h1>RigVeda Hymn 09071</h1>
</header>



<main>
<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>THE guerdon is bestowed: the Mighty takes his Seat, and, ever-Watchful, guards from fiend and evil sprite.</p><p>Gold-hued, he makes the cloud his diadem, the milk his carpet in both worlds, and prayer his robe of state.</p><p>Strong, bellowing, he goes, like one who subdues the folk; he lets this hue of Devass flow off from him, Throws off his covering, seeks his father's meeting-place, and thus makes for himself the bright robe he assumes.</p><p>Onward he flows, from both the hands, pressed out with stones: excited by the prayer, the water makes him wild. He frolics and draws near, completes his work with song, and bathes in streams to satisfy the worshipper.</p><p>They pour out meath around the Master of the house, Celestial Strengthener of the mountain that gives might; In whom, through his great powers, oblation-eating cows in their uplifted udder mix their choicest milk.</p><p>They, the ten sisters, on the lap of Aditi, have sent him forward like a car from both the arms. He wanders and comes near the Cow's mysterious place, even the place which his inventions have produced.</p><p>Like as a falcon to his home, so speeds the Deva to his own golden wisely-tashioned place to rest. With song they urge the darling to the sacred grass: the Holy One goes like a courser to the Devas.</p><p>From far away, from Heaven, the redhued noted Sage, Steer of the triple height, hath sung unto the kine. With thousand guidings he, leading this way and that, shines, as a singer, splendidly through many a morn.</p><p>His covering assumes a radiant hue; where&#146;er he comes into the fight he drives the foe afar. The Winner of the Floods, with food he seeks the host of Heaven, he comes to praises glorified with milk.</p><p>Like a bull roaming round the herds he bellows: he hath assumed the brilliancy of S&#363;rya. Down to the Earth hath looked the heavenly Falcon: Soma with wisdom views all living creatures.</p>
