<h1>HYMN LII. Gods.</h1>
<p>INSTRUCT me, all ye Devas, how I, elected your Monk, must seat me here, and how address you.</p>

<p>INSTRUCT me, all ye Devas, how I, elected your Monk, must seat me here, and how address you.</p><p>Instruct me how to deal to each his portion, and by what ' path to bring you man's oblation.</p><p>I sit as Monk most skilled in sacrificing: the Devas and all Deities impel me. A&#347;vins, each day yours is the Adhvaryu's duty: Brahman and wood are here: &#146;tis yours to offer.</p><p>Who is the Monk? Is he the Monk of Yama? On whom is thrust this God-appointed honour? He springs to life each month, each day that passes; so Devas have made him their oblation-bearer.</p><p>The Devas have made me bearer of oblations, who slipped away and passed through many troubles. Wise Agni shall ordain for us the worship, whether five-wayed, threefold, or seven-threaded.</p><p>So will I win you strength and life forever. O Devas, that . May give you room and freedom. To Indra's arms would I consign the thunder; in all these battles shall he then be victor.</p><p>The Deities three hundred and thirty-nine, have served and honoured Agni, Strewn sacred grass, anointed him with butter, and seated him as Monks&#146; Invoker.</p>
