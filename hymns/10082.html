<h2>HYMN LXXXII. Visvakarman.</h2>

<main>
<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>THE Father of the eye, the Wise in spirit, created both these worlds submerged in fatness.</p><p>Then when the eastern ends were firmly fastened, the heavens and the Earth were far extended.</p><p>Mighty in mind and power is Visvakarman, maker, Disposer, and most lofty Presence. Their offerings joy in rich juice where they value One, only One, beyond the Seven &#7770;&#7779;is.</p><p>Father who made us, he who, as Disposer, knoweth all races and all things existing, Even he alone, the Deities' narne-giver,him other beings seek for information.</p><p>To him in offerings they offered treasures,&#151;&#7770;&#7779;is of old, in numerous troops, as singers, who, in the distant, near, and lower region, made ready all these things that have existence.</p><p>That which is earlier than this Earth and Heaven, before the Devass and Devas had being,&#151; What was the germ primeval which the waters received where all the Devas were seen together?</p><p>The waters, they received that germ primeval wherein the Devas were gathefed all together. It rested set upon the Unborn's navel, that One wherein abide all things existing.</p><p>Ye will not find him who produced these creatures: another thing hath risen up among you. Enwrapt in misty cloud, with lips that stammer, hymn-chanters wander and are discontented.</p>
