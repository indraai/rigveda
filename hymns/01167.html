<h1>HYMN CLXVII. Indra. Devas.</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>A THOUSAND are thy helps for us, O Indra: a thousand, Lord of Bays, thy choice refreshments.</p><p>Wealth of a thousand sorts hast thou to cheer us. May precious goods come nigh to us in thousands.</p><p>May the most sapient Devas, with protection, with best boons brought from lofty Heaven, approach . Now when their team of the most noble horses speeds even on the sea's extremest limit.</p><p>Close to them clings one moving in seclusion, like a man's wife, like a spear carried rearward, well grasped, bright, decked with gold there is Vāk also, like to a courtly, eloquent dame, among them.</p><p>Far off the brilliant, never-weary Devas cling to the young Maid as a joint possession. The Devas wished for her to grow their friend and fellow.</p><p>She climbed her servant's chariot, she like Sūrya with cloud-like motion and refulgent aspect.</p><p>Upon their car the young men set the Maiden wedded to glory, mighty in assemblies, when your song, Devas, rose, and, with oblation, the Soma-pourer sang his hymn in worship.</p><p>I will declare the greatness of these Devas, their real greatness, worthy to be lauded. How, with them, she though firm, strong-minded, haughty, travels to women happy in their fortune.</p><p>Indra guards from censure. Firm things are overthrown that ne’er were shaken: he prospers, Devas, who gives choice oblations.</p><p>None of us, Devas, near or at a distance, hath ever reached the limit of your vigour. They in courageous might still waxing boldly have compassed round their foemen like an ocean.</p><p>May we this day be dearest friends of Indra, and let us call on him in fight to-morrow. So were we erst. New might attend us daily! So be with us! Ṛbhukṣan of the Heroes!</p><p>May this your laud, may this your song, O Devas, sung by the poet, Māna's son, Māndārya, Bring offspring for ourselves with. food to feed us. May we find strengthening food in full abundance.</p>
