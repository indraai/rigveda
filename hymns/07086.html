<h1>HYMN LXXXVI. Varu&#7751;a.</h1>
<p>WISE, verily, are creatures through his greatness who stayed ever, spacious Heaven and Earth asunder;</p>

<p>WISE, verily, are creatures through his greatness who stayed ever, spacious Heaven and Earth asunder; Who urged the high and mighty sky to motion, the Star of old, and spread the Earth before him.</p><p>With mine own heart I commune on the question how Varu&#7751;a and . May be united.</p><p>What gift of mine will he accept unangered? Whe. May I calmly look and find him gracious?</p><p>Fain to know this is my sin I question others: I seek the wise, O Varu&#7751;a, and ask them. This one same answer even the sages gave me, "Surely this Varu&#7751;a is angry with thee."</p><p>What, Varu&#7751;a, hath been my chief transgression, that thou wouldst subdue the friend who sings thy praises? Tell me, Unconquerable Lord, and quickly sinless will I approach thee with mine homage.</p><p>Free us from sins committed by our fathers, from those wherein we have ourselves offended. O King, loose, like a thief who feeds the cattle, as from the cord a calf, set free Vasi&#7779;&#7789;ha.</p><p>Not our own will betrayed us, but seduction, thoughtlessness, Varu&#7751;a wine, dice, or anger. The old is near to lead astray the younger: even sleep removeth not all evil-doing.</p><p>Slavelik. May I do service to the Bounteous, serve, free from sin inclined to anger. This gentle Lord gives wisdom to the simple: the wiser God leads on the wise to riches.</p><p>O Lord, O Varu&#7751;a. May this laudation come close to thee and lie within thy spirit. May it be well with us in rest and labour. Preserve us ever-more, ye Devas, with blessings.</p>
