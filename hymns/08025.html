<main>
<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>I WORSHIP you who guard this All, Devas, holiest among the Devas, You, faithful to the Law, whose power is sanctified.</p><p>So, too, like charioteers are they, Mitra and sapient Varu&#7751;a, Sons high-born from of old, whose holy laws stand fast.</p><p>These Twain, possessors of all wealth, most glorious, for supremest sway Aditi, Mighty Mother, true to Law, brought forth.</p><p>Great Varu&#7751;a and Mitra, Devas, Devass and imperial Lords, True to Eternal Law proclaim the high decree.</p><p>The offspring of a lofty Power, Dak&#7779;a's Two Son exceeding strong, who, Lords of flowing rain, dwell in the place of food.</p><p>Ye who have gathered up your gifts, celestial and terrestrial food, Let your rain come to us fraught with the mist of Heaven.</p><p>The Twain, who from the lofty sky seem to look down on herds below, Holy, imperial Lords, are set to be revered.</p><p>They, true to Law, exceeding strong, have sat them down for savran rule: Princes whose laws stand fast, they have obtained their sway.</p><p>Pathfinders even better than the eye, with unobstructed sight, Even when they close their lids, observant, they perceive.</p><p>May the Goddess Aditi. May the N&#257;satyas guard us well, the Martits guard us well.endowed with mighty strength.</p><p>Do ye, O Bounteous Devas, protect our dwelling lace by day and night: With you for our defender. May we go unharmed.</p><p>May we, unharmed, serve bountiful Vi&#7779;&#7751;u who slayeth none: Self-moving Sindhu hear and be the first to mark.</p><p>This sure protection we elect, desirable and reaching far, Which Mitra, Varu&#7751;a, and Aryaman afford.</p><p>An. May the Sindhu of the floods, the Devas, and the ASvin Pair, Boon Indra, and boon Vi&#7779;&#7751;u have one mind with us.</p><p>Because these warring Heroes stay the enmity of every foe, as the fierce water-flood repels the furious ones.</p><p>Here this one Deva, the Lord of men, looks forth exceeding far and wide: And we, for your advantage, keep his holy laws.</p><p>We keep the old accustomed laws, the statutes of supremacy, the Iong-known laws of Mitra and of Varu&#7751;a.</p><p>He who hath measured with his ray the boundaries of Heaven and Earth, and with his majesty hath filled the two worlds full,</p><p>S&#363;rya hath spread his light aloft up to the region of the sky, like Agni all aflame when gifts are offered him.</p><p>With him who sits afar the word is lord of food that comes from kine, Controller of the gift of unempoisoned food.</p><p>So unto S&#363;rya, Heaven, and Earth at morning and at eve I speak.</p><p>Bringing enjoyments ever rise thou up for us.</p><p>From Uksanyayana a bay, from Harayana a white steed, and from Susaman we obtained a hamessed car.</p><p>These two shall bring me further gain of troops of tawny-coloured steeds, the carriers shall they be of active men of war.</p><p>And the two sages have I gained who hold the reins and bear the whip, and the two great strong coursers, with my newest song.</p>
