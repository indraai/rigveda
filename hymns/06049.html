<p>I LAUD with newest songs the Righteous People, Mitra and Varu&#7751;a who make us happy.</p><p>Let them approach, here let them listen,Agni, Varu&#7751;a, Mitra, Lords of fair dominion.</p><p>Him, to be praised at each tribe's offers, the Two young Matrons' sober-minded Herald, the Son of Strength, the Child of Heaven, the signal of offering, red Agni will I worship.</p><p>Unlike in form are the Red Deva's two Daughters: one is the Sun's, and stars bedeck the other. Apart, the Sanctifiers, in succession, come to the famed hymn, praised in holy verses.</p><p>I with a lofty song call hither V&#257;yu, all-bounteous, filler of his car, most wealthy. Thou, Sage, with bright path, Lord of harnessed horses, impetuous, promptly honourest the prudent.</p><p>That chariot of the A&#347;vins, fair to look on, pleaseth me well, yoked with a thought, refulgent, Wherewith, N&#257;satyas, Chiefs, ye seek our dwelling, to give new strength to us and to our children.</p><p>Bulls of the Earth, O V&#257;ta and Parjanya, stir up for us the regions of the water. Hearers of truth, ye, Sages, World-Supporters, increase his living wealth whose songs delight you.</p><p>May Sarasvat&#299;, the Hero's Consort, brisk with rare life, the lightning's Child, inspire us, and, with the Dames accordant, give the singer a refuge unassailable and flawless.</p><p>I praise with eloquence him who guards all pathways. He, when his love impelled him, went to Arka. May he vouchsafe us gear with gold to grace it. May P&#363;&#7779;an make each prayer of ours efective.</p><p>May Herald Agni, fulgent, bring for worship Tva&#7779;&#7789;ar adored, in homes and swift to listen, Glorious, first to share, the life-bestower, the ever active Deva, fair-armed, fair-handed.</p><p>Soma by day, Soma at night we honour with these our songs, the Universe's Father. Him great and lofty, blissful, undecaying let us call specially as the Sage impels us.</p><p>Ye who are youthful, wise, and meet for worship, come, Martits, to the longing of the singer. Coming, as erst to A&#7749;giras, O Heroes, ye animate and quicken e&#146;en the desert.</p><p>Even as the herdsman driveth home his cattle, I urge my songs to him the strong swift Hero May he, the glorious, lay upon his body the singer's hymns, as stars bedeck the Heaven.</p><p>He who for man's behoof in his afiliction thrice measured out the earthly regions, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u- When one so great as thou affordeth shelter. May we with wealth and with ourselves be happy.</p><p>Sweet be this song of mine to Ahibudhnya, Parvata, Indra, with Floods and Lightnings; Sweet, with the Plants, to Devas who seek oblations. May liberal Bhaga speed us on to riches.</p><p>Give riches borne on cars, with many heroes, contenting men, the guard of mighty Order. Give us a lasting home that we may battle with godless bands of men who fight against us, and meet with tribes to whom the Devas are gracious.</p>
