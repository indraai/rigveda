<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>To Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, to the Mighty whom the Devas follow let your hymns born in song go forth, Evayamarut; To the impetuous, strong band, adorned with bracelets, that rushes on in joy and ever roars for vigour.</p><p>They who with might were manifest, and who willingly by their own knowledge told it forth, Evayamarut.</p><p>Devas, this strength of yours no wisdom comprehendeth: through their gifts' greatness they are moveless as the mountains.</p><p>Who by the psalm they sing are heard, from lofty Heaven, the strong, the brightly shining Ones, Evayamarut; In whose abode there is no mightier one to move them, whose lightnings are as fires, who urge the roaring rivers.</p><p>He of the Mighty Stride forth strode, Evayamarut, out of the spacious dwelling-place, their home in common. When he, himself, hath yoked his emulous strong horses on heights, he cometh forth, joy-giving, with the Heroes.</p><p>Like your tremendous roar, the rainer with light flashing, strong, speeding, hath made all tremble, Evayamarut, Wherewith victorious ye, self-luminous, press onward, with strong reins, decked with gold, impetuous and well-weaponed.</p><p>Unbounded is your greatness, ye of mighty power. May your bright vigour be our aid, Evayamarut; For ye are visible helpers in the time of trouble: like fires, aglow with light, save us from shame and insult.</p><p>May the Somas, mighty warriors, Evayamarut, with splendid brilliancy, like fires, be our protectors; They whose terrestrial dwelling-place is wide-extended, whom none suspect of sin, whose bands have lofty courage.</p><p>Come in a friendly spirit, come to us, O Devas, and hear his call who praises you, Evayamarut. Like car-borne men, one-minded with the mighty Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, keep enmity far from us with your deeds of wonder.</p><p>Come to our offering, ye Hnly Ones, to bless it, and, free from demons, hear our call, Evayamarut.</p>
