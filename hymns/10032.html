<h2>HYMN XXXII. Indra.</h2>

<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>FORTH speed the Pair to bring the meditating Deva, benevolent with boons sent in return for boons.</p><p>May Indra graciously accept both gifts from us, when he hath knowledge of the flowing Soma juice.</p><p>Thou wanderest far, O Indra, through the spheres of light and realms of Earth, the region, thou whom many praise! Let those who often bring their solemn rites conquer the noisy babblers who present no gifts.</p><p>More beautiful than beauty must this seem to me, when the son duly careth for his parents' line. The wife attracts the husband: with a shout of joy the man's auspicious marriage is performed aright.</p><p>This beauteous place of meeting have I looked upon, where, like milch-cows, the kine order the marriage train; Where the Herd's Mother counts as first and best of all, and round her are the seven-toned people of the choir.</p><p>The Pious One hath reached your place before the rest: One only moves victorious with the Somas' band. To these your helpers pour our meath, Immortal Devas, with whom your song of praise hath power to win their gifts.</p><p>He who maintains the Laws of Deva informed me that thou wast lying hidden in the waters. Indra, who knoweth well, beheld and showed thee. By him instructed am I come, O Agni.</p><p>The stranger asks the way of him who knows it: taught by the skilful guide he travels onward. This is, in truth, the blessing of instruction: he finds the path that leads directly forward.</p><p>Even now he breathed: these days hath he remembered. Concealed, he sucked the bosom of his Mother. Yet in his youth old age hath come upon him: he hath grown gracious, good, and free from anger.</p><p>O Kalasa, all these blessings will we bring them, O Kurusravana, who give rich presents. May he, O wealthy princes, and this Soma which I am bearing in my heart, reward you.</p>
