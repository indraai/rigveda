<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>ON a high car, O Parvata and Indra, bring pleasant offerings, with brave heroes, hither.</p><p>Enjoy the gifts, Devas, at our offerings wax strong by hymns, rejoice in our oblation.</p><p>Stay still, O Indra, advance no farther. a draught of well-pressed Soma will I give thee. With sweetest song I grasp, O Mighty Indra, thy garment's hem as a child grasps his father's.</p><p>Adhvaryu, sing we both; sing thou in answer: make we a laud acceptable to Indra. Upon this offerer's grass he seated: to Indra shall our eulogy be uttered.</p><p>A wife, O Indra is home and dwelling: so let thy Bay Steeds yoked convey thee hither. Whenever we press out for thee the Soma, let Agni as our Herald speed to call thee.</p><p>Depart, O Indra;again come hither: both there and here thy goat is Indra, Brother, Where thy tall chariot hath a place to rest in, and where thqu loosest thy loud-neighing Courser.</p><p>Thou hast drunk Soma, Indra, turn thee homeward; thy joy is in thy home, thy racious Consort; Where thy tall chariot hath a place to rest in, and thy strong Courser is set free with guerdon.</p><p>Bounteous are these, A&#7749;girases, Virupas: the Devas's Heroes and the Sons of Heaven. They, giving store of wealth to Vi&#347;v&#257;mitra, prolong his life through countless Soma-pressings.</p><p>Indra weareth every shape at pleasure, effecting magic changes in his body, Holy One, drinker out of season, coming thrice, in a moment, through fit prayers, from Heaven.</p><p>The mighty sage, God-born and God-incited, who looks on men, restrained the billowy river. When Vi&#347;v&#257;mitra was Sud&#257;s's escort, then Indra through the Ku&#347;ikas grew friendly.</p><p>Like swans, prepare a song of praise with pressing-stones, glad in your hymns with juice poured forth in offering. Ye singers, with the Devas, sages who look on men, ye Kutikas drink up the Soma's savoury meath.</p><p>Come forward, Ku&#347;ikas, and be attentive; let loose Sud&#257;s's horse to win him riches. East, west, and north, let the King subdue the foeman, then at Earth's choicest place perform his worship.</p><p>Praises to Indra have I sung, sustainer of this Earth and Heaven. This prayer of Vi&#347;v&#257;mitra keeps secure the race of Bharatas.</p><p>The Vi&#347;v&#257;mitras have sung forth this prayer to Indra Thunder-aimed: So let him make us prosperous.</p><p>Among the Kikatas what do thy cattle? They pour no milky draught, they heat no caldron. Bring thou to us the wealth of Pramaganda;give up to us, O Indra, the low-born.</p><p>Sasarpari, the gift of Jamadagnis, hath lowed with mighty voice dispelling famine. The Daughter of the Sun hath spread our glory among the Devas, imperishable, deathless.</p><p>Sasarpari brought glory speedily to these, over the generations of the Fivefold Race; Daughter of Paksa, she bestows new vital power, she whom the ancient Jamadagnis gave to me.</p><p>Strong be the pair of oxen, firm the axles, let not the pole slip nor the yoke be broken. May Indra, keep the yoke-pins from decaying: attend us, thou whose fellies are uninjured.</p><p>O Indra, give our bodies strength, strength to the bulls who draw the wains, Strength to our seed and progeny that the, may live, for thou art he who giveth strength.</p><p>Enclose thee in the heart of Khayar timber, in the car wrought of Sinsapa put firmness. Show thyself strong, O Axle, fixed and strengthened: throw us not from the car whereon we travel.</p><p>Let not this sovran of the wood leave us forlorn or injure us. Saf. May we be until we reach our homes and rest us and unyoke.</p><p>With various aids this day come to us, Indra, with best aids speed us, Indra, thou Hero. Let him who hatcth us fall headlong downward: him whom we hate let vital breath abandon.</p><p>He heats his very axe, and then cuts a mere Semal blossom off. O Indra, like a caldron cracked and seething, so he pours out foam.</p><p>Men notice not the arrow, O ye people; they bring the red beast deeming it a bullock. A sluggish steed men run not with the courser, nor ever lead an ass before a charger.</p><p>These men, the sons of Bh&#257;rata, O Indra, regard not severance or close connexion. They urge their own steed as it were another's, and take him, swift as the bow's string, to battle.</p>
