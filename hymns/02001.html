<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>THOU, Agni, shining in thy glory through the days, art brought to life from out the waters, from the stone: From out the forest trees and herbs that grow on ground Sovran Lord of men art generated pure.</p><p>Thine is the Herald's task and Cleanser's duly timed; Leader art thou, and Kindler for the pious man.</p><p>Thou art Director, thou the ministering Monk, Lord and Master in our home.</p><p>Hero of Heroes, Agni! Thou art Indra, thou art Indra of the Mighty Stride, adorable: Thou, Soma O Sustainer, with thy wisdom tendest us.</p><p>Agni, thou art King Indra whose laws stand fast; as Mitra, Wonder-Worker, thou must be implored. Aryaman, heroes' Lord, art thou, enriching all, and liberal Aṁśa in the synod, O thou Deva.</p><p>Thou givest strength, as Tvaṣṭar, to the worshipper: thou wielding Mitra's power hast kinship with the Dames. Thou, urging thy fleet coursers, givest noble steeds: a host of heroes art thou with great store of wealth.</p><p>Soma art thou, the Devas of mighty Heaven: thou art the Devas’ host, thou art the Lord of food, Thou goest with red winds: bliss hast thou in thine home. As Pūṣan thou thyself protectest worshippers.</p><p>Giver of wealth art thou to him who honours thee; thou art Deva Indra, granter of precious things. As Bhaga, Lord of men! thou rulest over wealth, and guardest in his house him who hath served thee well.</p><p>To thee, the people's Lord within the house, the folk press forward to their King most graciously inclined. Lord of the lovely look, all things belong to thee: ten, hundred, yea, a thousand are outweighed by thee.</p><p>Agni, men seek thee as a Father with their prayers, win thee, bright-formed, to brotherhood with holy act. Thou art a Son to him who duly worships thee, and as a trusty Friend thou guardest from attack.</p><p>A Ṛbhu art thou, Agni, near to be adored thou art the Sovran Lord of foodful spoil and wealth. Thou shinest brightly forth, thou burnest to bestow: pervading offering, thou lendest us thine help.</p><p>Thou, Deva, art Aditi to him who offers gifts: thou, Hotrā, Bhāratī, art strengthened by the song. Thou art the hundred-wintered Iḷā to give strength, Lord of Wealth! Vṛtra-slayer and Sarasvatī.</p><p>Thou, Agni, cherished well, art highest vital power; in thy delightful hue are glories visible. Thou art the lofty might that furthers each design: thou art wealth manifold, diffused on every side.</p><p>Thee, Agni, have the Ādityas taken as their mouth; the Bright Ones have made thee, O Sage, to be their tongue. They who love offerings cling to thee at solemn rites: by thee the Devas devour the duly offered food.</p><p>By thee, O Agni, all the Immortal guileless Devas cat with thy mouth the oblation that is offered them. By thee do mortal men give sweetness to their drink. Bright art thou born, the embryo of the plants of Earth.</p><p>With these thou art united, yea thou, Deva of noble birth, surpassest them in majesty, Which, through the power of good, here spreads abroad from thee, diffused through both the worlds, throughout the Earth and Heaven.</p><p>The princely worshippers who send to those who sing thy praise, O Agni, guerdon graced with kine and steeds. Lead thou both these and us forward to higher bliss. With brave men in the assembl. May we speak aloud.</p>
