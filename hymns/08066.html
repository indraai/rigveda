<p>SCARCELY was &#346;atakratu, born when of his Mother he inquired, who are the mighty? Who are famed?</p><p>Then &#346;avas&#299; declared to him Aur&#7751;av&#257;bha, Ah&#299;&#347;uva: Son, these be they thou must o&#146;erthrow</p><p>The V&#7771;tra-slayer smote them all as spokes are hammered into naves: The Dasyu-killer waxed in might.</p><p>Then Indra at a single draught drank the contents of thirty pails, Pails that were filled with Soma juice.</p><p>Indra in groundless realms of space pierced the Gandharva through, that he Might make Brahmans' strength increase.</p><p>Down from the mountains Indra shot hither his well-directed shaft: He gained the ready brew of rice.</p><p>One only is that shaft of thine, with thousand feathers, hundred barbs, Which, Indra, thou hast made thy friend.</p><p>Strong as the &#7770;bhus at thy birth, therewith to those who praise thee, men, and women, bring thou food to eat.</p><p>By thee these exploits were achieved, the mightiest deeds, abundantly: Firm in thy heart thou settest them.</p><p>All these things Vi&#7779;&#7751;u brought, the Lord of ample stride whom thou hadst sent- A hundred buffaloes, a brew of rice and milk: and Indra, slew the ravening boar</p><p>Most deadly is thy bow, successful, fashioned well: good is thine arrow, decked with gold.</p><p>Warlike and well equipped thine arms are, which increase sweetness for him who drinks the sweet.</p>
