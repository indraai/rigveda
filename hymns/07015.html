<p>OFFER oblations in his mouth, the bounteous Deva's whom we must serve.</p><p>His who is nearest kin to us:</p><p>Who for the Fivefold People's take hath seated him in every home Wise, Youthful, Master of the house.</p><p>On all side. May that Agni guard our household folk and property; May he deliver us from woe.</p><p>I have begotten this new hymn for Agni, Falcon of the sky: Will he not give us of his wealth?</p><p>Whose lories when he glows in front of sacrite are fair to see, like wealth of one with hero sons.</p><p>May he enjoy this hallowed gift, Agni accept our songs, who bears Oblations, best of worshippers.</p><p>Lord of the house, whom men must seek, we set thee down, O Worshipped Onel Bright, rich in heroes, Agni! God</p><p>Shine forth at night and morn: through thee with fires are we provided well. Thou, rich in heroes, art our Friend.</p><p>The men come near thee for their gain, the singers with their songs of praise: Speech, thousandfold, comes near to thee.</p><p>Bright, Purifier, meet for praise, Immortal with refulgent glow, Agni drives R&#257;k&#7779;asas away.</p><p>As such, bring us abundant wealth, young Child of Strength, for this thou canst May Bhaga give us what is choice.</p><p>Thou, Agni, givest hero fame: Bhaga and Indra the Deva, and Did give us what is good.</p><p>Agni, preserve us from distress: consume our enemies, Eternal, with the hottest flames.</p><p>And, irresistible, be thou a mighty iron fort to us, with hundred walls for man's defence.</p><p>Do thou preserve us, eve and morn, from sorrow, from the wicked men, Infallible! by day and night.</p>
