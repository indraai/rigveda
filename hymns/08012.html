<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>JOY, Mightiest Indra, known and marked, sprung most from Soma-draughts, where thou smitest down the greedy fiend, for that we long.</p><p>Wherewith thou bolpest Adhrigu, the great Da&#347;agva, and the Deva Who stirs the sunlight, and the sea, for that we long.</p><p>Wherewith thou dravest forth like cars Sindhu and all the mighty floods To go the way ordained by Law, for that we long.</p><p>Accept this laud for aid, made pure like oil, thou Caster of the Stone, Whereby even in a moment thou hast waxen great.</p><p>Be pleased, Song-lover, with this song it flows abundant like the sea.</p><p>Indra, with all thy succours thou hast waxen great.</p><p>The Deva who from afar hath sent gifts to maintain our friendship's bond, Thou. spreading them like rain from Heaven, hast waxen great.</p><p>The beams that mark him have grown strong, the thunder rests between his arms, when, like the Sun, he hath increased both Heaven and Earth.</p><p>When, Mighty Lord of Heroes, thou didst cat a thousand buffaloes, then grew and waxed exceeding great thine Indra-power.</p><p>Indra consumeth with the rays of S&#363;rya the malicious man: Like Agni conquering the woods, he hath grown strong.</p><p>This newest thought of ours that suits the time approaches unto thee: Serving, beloved in many a place it metes and marks.</p><p>The pious germ of offering directly purifies the soul. By Indra's lauds it waxes great, it metes and marks.</p><p>Indra who wins the friend hath spread himself -draught: Like worshipper's dilating praise; it metes and marks.</p><p>He whom the sages, living men, have gladdened, offering up their hymns, Hath swelled like oil of offering in Agni's mouth.</p><p>Aditi also hath brought forth a hymn for Indra, Sovran Lord: The work of offering for help is glorified.</p><p>The ministering monks have sung their songs for aid and eulogy: Deva, thy Bays turn not from the rite which Law ordains.</p><p>If, Indra, thou drink Soma by Vi&#7779;&#7751;u's or T&#7771;ta &#256;ptya's side, or with the Devas take delight in flowing drops;</p><p>Or, &#346;akra, if thou gladden thee afar or in the sea of air, Rejoice thee in this juice of ours, in flowing drops.</p><p>Or, Lord of Heroes if thou aid the worshipper who shed; the, juice, or him whose laud delights thee, and his flowing drops.</p><p>To magnify the Deva, Indra, yea, Indra for your help, and promptly end the offering-this have they gained.</p><p>With worship, him whom men adore, with Soma, him who drinks it most, Indra with lauds have they increasedthis have they gained.</p><p>His leadings are with power and might and his instructions manifold: He gives the worshipper all wealth: this have they gained.</p><p>For subduing V&#7771;tra have the Devas set Indra in the foremost place. Indra the choral bands have sung, for vigorous strength.</p><p>We to the Mighty with our might, with lauds to him who hears our call, with holy hymns have sung aloud, for vigorous strength.</p><p>Not Earth, nor Heaven, nor firmaments contain the Thunder-wielding God: They shake before his violent rush and vigorous strength.</p><p>What time the Devas, O Indra, get thee foremost in the furious fight, then thy two beautiful Bay Steeds carried thee on.</p><p>When V&#7771;tra, stayer of the floods, thou si"est, Thundeicr with might, then thy two beautiful Bay Steeds carried thee on.</p><p>When Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, through thine energy, strode wide those three great steps of his, then thy two beautiful Bay Steeds carried thee on.</p><p>When thy two beautiful Bay Steeds grew great and greater day by day, Even then all creatures that had life bowed down to thee.</p><p>When, Indra, all the Marut folk humbly submitted them to thee, Even then all creatures that had life bowed down to thee.</p><p>When yonder Sun, that brilliant light, thou settest in the Heaven above, Even then all creatures that had life bowed down to thee.</p><p>To thee, O Indra, with this thought the sage lifts up this eulogy, Akin and leading as on foot to offerings.</p><p>When in thine own dear dwelling all gathered have lifted up the voice Milk-streams at worship's central spot, for offering,</p><p>As Monk, O Indra, give us wealth in brave men and good steeds ana kine That we may first remember thee for offering.</p>
