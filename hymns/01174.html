<h2>HYMN CLXXIV. Indra.</h2>

<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>THOU art the King of all the Devas, O Indra: protect the men, O Devas, preserve us.</p><p>Thou Lord of Heroes, Indra, our saver, art faithful, very rich, the victory-giver.</p><p>Indra, thou humbledst tribes that spake with insult by breaking down seven autumn forts, their refuge. Thou stirredst, billowy floods, and gavest his foe a prey to youthful Purukutsa.</p><p>With whom thou drivest troops whose lords are heroes, and bringest daylight now, much worshipped Indra, with them guard lion-like wasting active Agni to dwell in our tilled fields and in our homestead.</p><p>They through the greatness of thy spear, O Indra, shall, to thy praise, rest in this earthly station. To loose the floods, to seek, for kine, the battle, his Bays he mounted boldly seized the booty.</p><p>Indra, him in whom thou joyest: the dark-red horses of the Wind are docile. Let the Sun roll his chariot wheel anear us, and let the Thunderer go to meet the foemen.</p><p>Thou Indra, Lord of Bays, made strong by impulse. They who beheld the Friend beside the living were cast aside by thee as they rode onward.</p><p>Indra, the bard sang forth in inspiration: thou madest Earth a covering for the D&#257;sa. Indra made the three that gleam with moisture, and to his home brought Kuyav&#257;c to subdue him.</p><p>These thine old deeds new bards have sung, O Indra. Thou conqueredst, boundest many tribes forever. Like castles thou hast crushed the godless races, and bowed the godless scorner's deadly weapon.</p><p>A Stormer thou hast made the stormy waters flow down, O Indra, like the running rivers. When o&#146;er the flood thou broughtest them, O Hero, thou keptest Turva&#347;a and Yadu safely.</p><p>Indra, mayst thou be ours in all occasions, protector of the men, most gentle-hearted, giving us victory over all our rivals. May we find strengthening food in full abundance.</p>
