<h2>HYMN XL. Indra-Agni.</h2>

<main>
<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>INDRA and Agni, surely ye as Conquerors will give us wealth, Whereby in fight we may o&#146;ercome that which is strong and firmly fixed, as Agni burns the woods with wind. Let all the others die away.</p><p>We set no snares to tangle you; Indra we worship and adore. Hero of heroes mightiest.</p><p>Onc. May he come unto us with his Steed, come unto us to win us strength, and to complete the offering.</p><p>For, famous Indra-Agni, ye are dwellers in the midst of frays. Sages in wisdom, ye are knit to him who seeketh you as friends. Heroes, bestow on him his wish.</p><p>Nabh&#257;ka-like, with sacred song Indra's and Agni's praise I sing, theirs to whom all this world belongs, this Heaven and this mighty Earth which bear rich treasure in their lap.</p><p>To Indra and to Agni send your meditations, as was Nabh&#257;ka's wont,&#151. Who oped with sideway opening the sea with its foundations seven&#151;Indra all powerful in his might.</p><p>Tear thou asunder, as of old, like tangles of a creeping plant, Demolish thou the D&#257;sa's might. May we with Indra's help divide the treasure he hath gathered up.</p><p>What time with this same song these men call Indra-Agni sundry ways, May we with our own heroes quell those who provoke us to the fight, and conquer those who strive with us.</p><p>The Two refulgent with their beams rise and come downward from the sky. By Indra's and by Agni's hest, flowing away, the rivers, run which they released from their restraint.</p><p>O Indra, many are thine aids, many thy ways of guiding us, Lord of the Bay Steeds, Hinva's Son. To a Good Hero come our meditations, which soon shall have accomplishment.</p><p>Inspire him with your holy hymns, the Hero bright and glorious, him who with might demolisheth even the brood of &#346;u&#7779;&#7751;a, and winneth for us the heavenly streams.</p><p>Inspire him worshipped with fair rites, the glorious Hero truly brave. He brake in pieces &#346;u&#7779;&#7751;a's brood who still expected not the stroke, and won for us the heavenly streams. Let all the others die away.</p><p>Thus have we sung anew to Indra-Agni, as sang our sires, A&#7749;girases, and Mandh&#257;tar. Guard us with triple shelter and preserve us. May we be masters of a store of riches.</p>
