<div class="box hymn"><p>THESE rapid Soma-drops have been poured through the purifying sieve To bring us all felicities.</p><p>Dispelling manifold mishap, giving the courser's progeny, Yea, and the warrior steed, success.</p><p>Bringing prosperity to kine, they make perpetual I·∏∑ƒÅ flow To us for noble eulogy.</p><p>Strong, mountain-born, the stalk hath been pressed in the streams for rapturous joy: Hawk-like he settles in his home.</p><p>Fair is the Deva-loved juice; the plant is washed in waters, pressed by men The milch-kine sweeten it with milk.</p><p>As drivers deck a courser, so have they adorned the meath's juice for Ambrosia, for the festival.</p><p>Thou, indu, with thy streams that drop sweet juices, which were poured for help, Hast settled in the cleansing sieve.</p><p>So flow thou onward through the fleece, for Indra flow, to be his drink, Finding thine home in vats of wood.</p><p>As giving room and freedom, as most sweet, pour butter forth and milk, O Indu, for the A·πÖgirases.</p><p>Most active and benevolent, this Indu, sent to us For lofty friendship, meditates.</p><p>Queller of curses, mighty, with strong sway, this Indu shall Bring treasures to the worshipper.</p><p>Pour thou upon us thousandfold possessions, both of kine and steeds, Exceeding glorious, much-desired.</p><p>Wandering far, with wise designs, the juice here present is effused, Made beautiful by living men.</p><p>For Indra flows the gladdening drink, the measurer of the region, Sage, with countless wealth and endless help.</p><p>Born on the inountain, lauded here, indu for Indra is set down, as in her sheltering nest a bird.</p><p>Pressed by the men, as ‚Äôtwere to war hath Indu sped, to test with might within the vats.</p><p>That h. May move, they yoke him to the three-backed triple-seated car By the Seven ·πö·π£is‚Äô holy songs.</p><p>Drive ye that Tawny Courser, O ye pressers, on his way to war, Swift Steed who carries off the spoil.</p><p>Pouring all glories hither, he, effused and entering the jar, Stands like a hero mid the kine.</p><p>Indu, the living men milk out the juice to make the rapturous draught: Devas for the Devas milk out the meath.</p><p>Pour for the Devas into the sieve our Soma very rich in sweets, him whom the Devas most gladly hear.</p><p>Into his stream who gladdens best these Soma juices have been poured, Lauded with songs for lofty fame.</p><p>Thou flowest to enjoy the milk, and bringest valour, being cleansed: Winning the spoil flow hitherward.</p><p>And, hymned by Jamadagnis, let all nourishment that kine supply, and general praises, flow to us.</p><p>Soma, as leader of the song flow onward with thy wondrous aids, for holy lore of every kind.</p><p>Do thou as leader of the song, stirring the waters of the sea, Flow onward, thou who movest all.</p><p>O Soma, O thou Sage, these worlds stand ready to attest thy might: For thy behoof the rivers flow.</p><p>Like showers of rain that fall from Heaven thy streams perpetually flow To the bright fleece spread under them.</p><p>For potent Indra purify Indu effectual and strong, Enjoyment-giver, Mighty Lord.</p><p>Soma, true, indu, Sage, is seated in the cleansing sieve, giving his praiser hero strength.</p>
