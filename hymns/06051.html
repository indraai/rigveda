<p>THAT mighty eye of Varu&#7751;</p>

<p>THAT mighty eye of Varu&#7751;a and Mitra, infallible and dear, is moving upward.</p><p>The pure and lovely face of holy Order hath shone like gold of Heaven in its arising.</p><p>The Sage who knows these Devas&#146; three ranks and orders, and all their generations near and distant, beholding good and evil acts of mortals, S&#363;ra marks well the doing of the pious.</p><p>I praise you Guards of mighty Law eternal, Aditi, Mitra, Varu&#7751;a, the noble, Aryaman, Bhaga, all whose thoughts are faithful: hither I call the Bright who share in common.</p><p>Lords of the brave, infallible, foe-destroyers, great Kings, bestowers of fair homes to dwell in, Young, Heroes, ruling Heaven with strong dominion, &#256;dityas, Aditi I seek with worship.</p><p>O Heaven our Father, Earth our guileless Mother, O Brother Agni, and ye Devas, bless us. Grant us, O Aditi and ye &#256;dityas, all of one mind, your manifold protection.</p><p>Give us not up to any evil creature, as spoil to wolf or she-wolf, O ye Holy. For ye are they who guide aright our bodies, ye are the rulers of our speech and vigour.</p><p>Let us not suffer for the sin of others, nor do the deed which ye, O Devas, punish. Ye, Universal Devas! are all-controllers. May he do harm unto himself who hates Me.</p><p>Mighty is homage: I adopt and use it. Homage hath held in place the Earth and Heaven. Homage to Devas! Homage commands and rules them. I banish even committed sin by homage</p><p>You Furtherers of Law, pure in your spirit, infallible, dwellers in the home of Order, to you all Heroes mighty and far-seeing I bow me down, O Holy Ones, with homage.</p><p>For these are they who shine with noblest splendour; through all our troubles these conduct us safely- Varu&#7751;a, Mitra, Agni, mighty Rulers, trueminded, faithful to the hymn's controllers.</p><p>May they, Earth, Aditi, Indra, Bhaga, P&#363;&#7779;an increase our laud, increase the Fivefold people. Giving good help, good refuge, goodly guidance, be they our good deliverers, good protectors.</p><p>Come now, O Devas, to your celestial station: the Bharadv&#257;jas' priest entreats your favour. He, sacrificing, fain for wealth, hath honoured the Devas vath those who sit and share oblations.</p><p>Agni, drive thou the wicked foe, the evil-hearted thief away, Far, far, Lord of the brave I and give us easy paths.</p><p>Soma, these pressing-stones have called aloud to win thee for our Friend. Destroy the greedy Pa&#7751;i, for a wolf is he.</p><p>Ye, O most bountiful, are they who, led by Indra, seek the sky. Give us good paths for travel: guard us ivell at home.</p><p>Now have we entered on the road that leads to bliss, without a foe, the road whereon a man escapes all enemies and gathers wealth.</p>
