<div class="box hymn"><p>THOU, Agni, who wilt have the strong, hast made me the Soma's priest, to worship in assembly.</p><p>Thou shinest to the Devas, I set the press-stones. I toil; be joyful in thyself, O Agni.</p><p>East have we turned the rite. May the hymn aid it. With wood and worship shall they honour Agni. From Heaven the synods of the wise have learnt it: e‚Äôen for the quick and strong they seek advancement.</p><p>The Prudent, he whose will is pure, brought welfare, allied by birth to Heaven and Earth in kinship. The Devas discovered in the midst of waters beautiful Agni with the Sisters' labour.</p><p>Him, Blessed One, the Seven strong Floods augmented, him white at birth and red when waxen mighty. As mother mares run to their new-born you ling, so at his birth the Devas wondered at Agni.</p><p>Spreading with radiant limbs throughout the region, purging his power with wise purifications, Robing himself in light, the life of waters, he spreads abroad his high and perfect glories.</p><p>He sought Heaven's Mighty Ones, the unconsuming, the unimpaired, not clothed and yet not naked. Then they, ancient and young, who dwell together, Seven sounding Rivers, as one germ received him.</p><p>His piles, assuming every form, are scattered where flow sweet waters, at the spring of fatness; There stood the milch-kine with full-laden udders, and both paired Mighty Mothers of the Wondrous.</p><p>Carefully cherished, Son of Strength, thou shoncst assuming lasting and refulgent beauties. Full streams of fatness and sweet juice descended, there where the Mighty One grew strong by wisdom.</p><p>From birth he knew even his Father's bosom, he set his voices and his streams in motion; Knew him who moved with blessed Friends in secret, with the young Dames of Heaven. He stayed not hidden.</p><p>He nursed the Infant of the Sire and Maker: alone the Babe sucked many a teeming bosom. Guard, for the Bright and Strong, the fellow-spouses friendly to men and bound to him in kinship.</p><p>The Mighty One increased in space unbounded; full many a glorious flood gave strength to Agni. Friend of the house, within the lap of Order lay Agni, in the Sister Rivers' service.</p><p>As keen supporter where great waters gather, light-shedder whom the brood rejoice to look on; He who begat, and will beget, the dawnlights, most manly, Child of Floods, is youthful Agni.</p><p>Him, varied in his form, the lovely Infant of floods and plants the blessed wood hath gendered. Devas even, moved in spirit, came around him, and served him at his birth, the Strong, the Wondrous.</p><p>Like brilliant lightnings, mighty luminaries accompany the light-diffusing Agni, waxen, as ‚Äôtwere in secret, in his dwelling, while in the boundless stall they milk out Am·πõta.</p><p>I sacrificing serve thee with oblations and crave with longing thy good-will and friendship. Grant, with the Devas, thy grace to him who lauds thee, protect us with thy rays that guard the homestead.</p><p>May we, O Agni, thou who leadest wisely, thy followers and masters of all treasures, Strong in the glory of our noble offspring, subdue the godless when they seek the battle.</p><p>Ensign of Devas hast thou become, O Agni, joy-giver, knower of all secret wisdom. Friend of the homestead, thou hast lightened mortals: carborne thou goest to the Devas, fulfilling.</p><p>Within the house hath sate the King immortal of mortals, filling full their sacred synods. Bedewed with holy oil he shineth widely, Agni, the knower of all secret wisdom.</p><p>Come unto us with thine auspicious friendship, come speeding, Mighty, with thy mighty assists. Grant us abundant wealth that saves from danger, that brings a good repute, a glorious portion.</p><p>To thee who art of old these songs, O Agni, have I declared, the ancient and the later. These great libations to the Strong are offiered: in every birth is JƒÅtavedas stablished.</p><p>Stablished in every birth is JƒÅtavedas, kindled perpetual by the Vi≈õvƒÅmitras. May we rest ever in the loving-kindness, in the auspicious grace of him the Holy.</p><p>This offering of ours do thou, O Mighty, O truly Wise, bear to the Devas rejoicing. Grant us abundant food, thou priestly Herald, vouchsafe to give us ample wealth, O Agni.</p><p>As holy food, Agni, to thine'invoker give wealth in cattle, lasting, rich in marvels. To us he born a son, and spreading offspring. Agni, be this thy gracious will to us-ward.</p>
