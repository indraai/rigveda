<h2>HYMN LXXXIII. Indra-Varu&#7751;a.</h2>

<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>LOOKING to you and your alliance, O ye Men, armed with broad axes they went forward, fain for spoil.</p><p>Ye smote and slew his D&#257;sa and his &#256;ryan enemies, and helped Sud&#257;s with favour, Indra-Varu&#7751;a.</p><p>Where heroes come together with their banners raised, in the encounter where is naught for us to love, Where all things that behold the light are terrified, there did ye comfort us, O Indra-Varu&#7751;a.</p><p>The boundaries of Earth were seen all dark with dust: O Indra-Varu&#7751;a, the shout went up to Heaven. The enmities of the people compassed me about. Ye heard my calling and ye came to me with help.</p><p>With your resistless weapons, Indra-Varu&#7751;a, ye conquered Bheda and ye gave Sud&#257;s your aid. Ye heard the prayers of these amid the cries of war: effectual was the service of the Trtsus' priest.</p><p>O Indra-Varu&#7751;a, the wickedness of foes and mine assailants' hatred sorely trouble me. Ye Twain are Lords of riches both of Earth and Heaven: so grant to us your aid on the decisive day.</p><p>The men of both the hosts invoked you in the fight, Indra and Varu&#7751;a, that they might win the wealth, What time ye helped Sud&#257;s, with all the Trtsu folk, when the Ten Kings had pressed him down in their attack.</p><p>Ten Kings who worshipped not, O Indra-Varu&#7751;a, confederate, in war prevailed not o&#146;er Sud&#257;s. True was the boast of heroes sitting at the feast: so at their invocations Devas were on their side.</p><p>O Indra-Varu&#7751;a, ye gave Sud&#257;s your aid when the Ten Kings in battle compassed him about, there where the white-robed Trtsus with their braided hair, skilled in song worshipped you with homage and with hymn.</p><p>One of you Twain destroys the V&#7771;tras in the fight, the Other evermore maintains his holy Laws. We call on you, ye Mighty, with our hymns of praise. Vouchsafe us your protection, Indra-Varu&#7751;a.</p><p>May Indra, Varu&#7751;a, Mitra, and Aryaman vouchsafe us glory and great shelter spreading far. We think of the beneficent light of Aditi, and Indra's song of praise who strengthens Law.</p>
