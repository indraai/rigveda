<h2>HYMN XXIII. Indra.</h2>

<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>How, what priest's offering hath he made mighty, rejoicing in the Soma and its fountain? Delighting in juice, eagerly drinking, the Lofty One hath waxed for splendid riches.</p><p>What hero hath been made his feast-companion? Who hath been partner in his loving-kindness? What know we of his wondrous acts? How often comes he to aid and speed the pious toiler?</p><p>How heareth Indra offered invocation? How, hearing, marketh he the invoker's wishes? What are his ancient acts of bounty? Wherefore call they him One who filleth full the singer?</p><p>How doth the Monk who laboureth, ever longing, win for himself the wealth which he possesseth? May he, mark well my truthful praises, having received the homage which he loveth.</p><p>How, and what bond of friendship with a mortal hath the Deva chosen as this morn is breaking? How, and what love hath he for those who love him, who have entwined in him their firm affection?</p><p>Is then thy friendship with thy friends most mighty? Thy brotherhood with us,&#151;whe. May we tell it? The streams of milk move, as most wondrous sunlight, the beauty of the Lovely One for glory.</p><p>About to stay the Indra-less destructive spirit he sharpens his keen arms to strike her.</p><p>Whereby the Strong, although our debts&#146; exactor, drives in the distant mornings that we know not.</p><p>Eternal Law hath varied food that strengthens; thought of eternal Law, removes transgressions. The praise-hymn of eternal Law, arousing, glowing, hath oped the deaf ears of the living.</p><p>Firm-seated are eternal Law's foundations in its fair form are many splendid beauties. By holy Law long lasting food they bring us; by holy Law have cows come to our worship.</p><p>Fixing eternal Law he, too, upholds it swift moves the might of Law and wins the booty. To Law belong the vast deep Earth and Heaven: Milch-kine supreme, to Law their milk they render.</p><p>Now, Indra! lauded,&#151;glorified with praises, let power swell high like rivers to the singer. For thee a new hymn, Lord of Bays, is fashioned. May we, car-borne, through song be victors ever.</p>
