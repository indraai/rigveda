<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>WHATEVER law of thine, O Varu&#7751;a, as we are men, Day after day we violate.</p><p>give us not as a prey to death, to be conquered by thee in wrath, to thy fierce anger when displeased.</p><p>To gain thy mercy, Varu&#7751;a, with hymns we bind thy heart, as binds The charioteer his tethered horse.</p><p>They flee from me dispirited, bent only on obtaining wealth, as to their nests the birds of air.</p><p>When shall we bring, to be appeased, the Hero, Lord of warrior might, him, the far-seeing Varu&#7751;a?</p><p>This, this with joy they both accept in common: never do they fail The ever-faithful worshipper.</p><p>He knows the path of birds that fly through Heaven, and, Sovran of the sea. He knows the ships that are thereon.</p><p>True to his holy law, he knows the twelve moons with their progeny: He knows the moon of later birth.</p><p>He knows the pathway of the wind, the spreading, high, and mighty wind: He knows the Devas who dwell above.</p><p>Varu&#7751;a, true to holy law, sits down among his people; he, most wise, sits there to govern all.</p><p>From thence perceiving he beholds all wondrous things, both what hath been, and what will be done.</p><p>May that &#256;ditya, very wise, make fair paths for us all our days: May he prolong our lives for us.</p><p>Varu&#7751;a, wearing golden mail, hath clad him in a shining robe.</p><p>His spies are seated found about.</p><p>The Deva whom enemies threaten not, nor those who tyrannize o&#146;er men, Nor those whose minds are bent on wrong.</p><p>He who gives glory to mankind, not glory that is incomplete, to our own bodies giving it.</p><p>Yearning for the wide-seeing One, my thoughts move onward unto him, as kine unto their pastures move.</p><p>Once more together let us speak, because my meath is brought: priest-like Thou eatest what is dear to thee.</p><p>Now saw I him whom al. May see, I saw his car above the Earth: He hath accepted these my songs.</p><p>Varu&#7751;a, hear this call of mine: be gracious unto us this day Longing for help I cried to thee.</p><p>Thou, O wise Deva, art Lord of all, thou art the King of Earth and Heaven, as thou goest on thy way.</p><p>Release us from the upper bond, untie the bond between, and loose the bonds below, that . May live.</p>
