<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>STRONG P콞攷므n's majesty is lauded evermore, the glory of his lordly might is never faint, his song of praise is never faint.</p><p>Seeking felicity I laud him nigh to help, the source, of bliss, who, Vigorous one, hath drawn to him the hearts of all, drawn them, the Vigorous One.</p><p>Thee, then, O P콞攷므n, like a swift one on his way, I urge with lauds that tho. Mayst make the foemen flee, drive, camel-like, our foes afar. As I, a man, call thee, a Deva, giver of bliss, to be my Friend, So make our loudly-chanted praises glorious, in battles make them glorious.</p><p>Thou, P콞攷므n, in whose friendship they who sing forth praise enjoy advantage, even in wisdom, through thy grace, in wisdom even they are advanced. So, after this most recent course, we come to thee with prayers for wealth. Not stirred to anger, O Wide-Ruler, come to us, come thou to us in every fight.</p><p>Not stirred to anger, come, free-giver, nigh to us, to take this gift of ours, thou who hast goats for steeds, Goat-borne! their gift who long for fame. So, Wonder-Worker. May we turn thee hither with effectual lauds. I slight thee not, O P콞攷므n, thou Resplendent One: thy friendshi. May not be despised.</p>
