<h2>HYMN LVIII. Devas.</h2>

<main>
<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>Now do I glorify their mighty cohort, the company of these the youthful Devas, who ride impetuous on with rapid horses, and radiant in themselves, are Lords of Am&#7771;ta.</p><p>The mighty glittering band, arm-bound with bracelets, givers of bliss, unmeasured in their greatness, with magical powers, bountiful, ever-roaring,&#151;these, liberal Heroes, venerate thou singer.</p><p>This da. May all your water-bringers, Devas, they who impel the falling rain, approach us.</p><p>This fire, O Devas, hath been duly kindled; let it find favour with you, youthful Sages.</p><p>Ye raise up for the folk an active ruler whom, Holy Ones! a Master's hand hath fashioned. Ye send the fighter hand to hand, armmighty, and the brave hero, Devas with good horses.</p><p>They spring forth more and more, strong in their glories, like days, like spokes where none are last in order. Highest and mightiest are the Sons of P&#7771;&#347;ni. Firm to their own intention cling the Devas.</p><p>When ye have hastened on with spotted coursers, O Devas, on your cars with strong-wrought fellies, the waters are disturbed, the woods are shattered. Let Devas the Red Steer send his thunder downward.</p><p>Even Earth hath spread herself wide at their coming, and they as husbands have with power impregned her. They to the pole have yoked the winds for coursers: their sweat have they made rain, these Sons of Soma.</p><p>Ho! Devas. Heroes, skilled in Law, immortal, be gracious unto us, ye rich in treasures, Ye hearers of the truth, ye sage and youthful, grown mighty, dwelling on the lofty mountains.</p>
