<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>INDRA, when Soma juices flow, makes his mind pure and meet for lauds.</p><p>He gains the power that brings success, for great is he.</p><p>In Heaven's first region, in the seat of Devas, is he who brings success, most glorious, prompt to save, who wins the water-floods.</p><p>Him, to win strength, have I invoked, even Indra mighty for the fray. Be thou most near to us for bliss, a Friend to aid.</p><p>Indra, Song -lover, here for thee the worshipper's libation flows. Rejoicing in this sacred grass thou shinest forth.</p><p>Even now, O Indra, give us that which, pressing juice, we crave of thee. Bring us wealth manifold which finds the light of Heaven.</p><p>What time the zealous worshipper hath boldly sung his songs to thee, like branches of a tree up-grows what they desire.</p><p>Generate songs even as of old, give car unto the singer's call. Thou for the pious hast grown great at each carouse.</p><p>Sweet strains that glorify him play like waters speeding down a slope, Yea, him who in this song is called the Lord of Heaven;</p><p>Yea, who alone is called the Lord, the single Ruler of the folk, by worshippers seeking aid. May he joy in the draught.</p><p>Praise him, the Glorious, skilled in song, Lord of the two victorious Bays: They seek the worshipper's abode who bows in meditation.</p><p>Put forth thy strength: with dappled Steeds come, thou of mighty intellect, with swift Steeds to the offering, for &#146;tis thy joy.</p><p>Grant wealth to those who praise thee, Lord of Heroes, Mightiest Indra: give Our princes everlasting fame and opulence.</p><p>I call thee when the Sun is risen, I call thee at the noon of day: With thy car-horses, Indra, come wellpleased to us.</p><p>Speed forward hither, come to us, rejoice thee in the milky draught: Spin out the thread of ancient time, as well is known.</p><p>If, &#346;akra, V&#7771;tra-slayer, thou be far away or near to us. Or in the sea, thou art the guard of Soma juice.</p><p>Let songs we sing and Soma-drops expressed by us make Indra strong: The tribes who bring oblations find delight in him.</p><p>Him sages longing for his aid, with offerings brought in eager haste, him. even as branches, all mankind have made to grow.</p><p>At the Trkadrukas the Devas span offering that stirred the mind: May our songs strengthen him who still hath strengthened us.</p><p>When, true to duty, at due times the worshipper offers lauds to thee, they call him Purifier, Pure, and Wonderful.</p><p>That mind of Soma, fresh and strong, moves conscious in the ancient ways, with reference whereto the wise have ordered this.</p><p>If thou elect to be my Friend drink of this sacrificial juice, by help whereof we may subdue all enemies.</p><p>O Indra, Lover of the song, when shall thy praiser be most blest? When wilt thou grant us wealth in herds of kine and steeds?</p><p>And thy two highIy-lauded Bays, strong stallions, draw thy car who art Untouched by age, most gladdening car for which we pray.</p><p>With ancient offerings we implore the Young and Strong whom many praise. He from of old hath sat upon dear sacred grass.</p><p>Wax miglity, thou whom many laud for aids which &#7770;&#7779;is have extolled. Pour down for us abundant food and guard us well.</p><p>O Indra, Caster of the Stone, thou helpest him who praises thee: From offering I send to thee a mindyoked hymn.</p><p>Here, yoking for the Soma-draught these Horses, sharers of thy feast, Thy Bay Steeds, Indra, fraught with weal tb, consent to come.</p><p>Attendants on thy glory, let the Somas roar assent to thee, and all the Marut companies come tothe feast.</p><p>These his victorious followers bold in the heavens the place they love, Leagued in the heart of offering, as well we know.</p><p>That we may long behold the light, what time the ordered rite proceeds, He duly measures, as he views, the offering.</p><p>O Indra, strong is this thy car, and strong are these Bay Steeds of thine: O &#346;atakratu, thou art strong, strong is our call.</p><p>Strong is the press-stone, strong thy joy, strong is the flowing Soma juice: Strong is the rite thou furtherest, strong is our call.</p><p>As strong I call on thee the Strong, O Thunderer with thy thousand aids: For thou hast won the hymn of praise. Strong is our call.</p>
