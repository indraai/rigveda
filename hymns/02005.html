<h1>HYMN V. Agni.</h1>
<p>HERALD and teacher was he born, a guardian for our patrons&#146;</p>
</section>
<main>
<p>HERALD and teacher was he born, a guardian for our patrons&#146; help, Earner by rites of noble wealth. That Strong On. May we grasp and guide;</p><p>In whom, Leader of offering, the seven reins, far extended, meet; Who furthers, man-like, eighth in place, as Cleanser, all the work divine.</p><p>When swift he follows this behest, bird-like he chants the holy prayers.</p><p>He holds all knowledge in his grasp even as the felly rounds the wheel.</p><p>Together with pure mental power, pure, as Director, was he born. Skilled in his own unchanging laws he waxes like the growing boughs.</p><p>Clothing them in his hues, the kine of him the Leader wait on him. Is he not better than the Three, the Sisters who have come to us?</p><p>When, laden with the holy oil, the Sister by the Mother stands, the Monk delights in their approach, as corn at coming of the rain.</p><p>For his support let him perform as ministrant his priestly task; Yea, song of praise and offering: we have bestowed, let us obtain.</p><p>That so this man well skilled. May pay worship to all the Holy Ones. And, Agni, this our offering which we have here prepared, to thee.</p>
