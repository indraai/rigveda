<h2>HYMN CXXXV. Yama.</h2>

<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>IN the Tree clothed with goodly leaves where Yama drinketh with the Devas, the Father, Master of the house, tendeth with love our ancient Sires.</p><p>I looked reluctantly on him who cherishes those men of old, On him who treads that evil path, and then I yearned for this again.</p><p>Thou mountest, though thou dost not see, O Child, the new and wheel-less car Which thou hast fashioned mentally, onepoled but turning every way.</p><p>The car which thou hast made to roll hitherward from the Sages, Child! This hath the S&#257;man followed close, hence, laid together on a ship.</p><p>Who was the father of the child? Who made the chariot roll away? Who will this day declare to us how the funeral gift was made?</p><p>When the funeral gift was placed, straightway the point of flame appeared.</p><p>A depth extended in the front: a passage out was made behind.</p><p>Here is the seat where Yama dwells, that which is called the Home of Devas: Here minstrels blow the flute for him here he is glorified with songs.</p>
