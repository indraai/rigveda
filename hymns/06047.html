<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>YEA, this is good to taste and full of. sweetness, verily it is strong and rich in flavour.</p><p>No on. May conquer Indra in the battle when he hath drunken of the draught we offer.</p><p>This sweet juice here had mightiest power to gladden: it boldened Indra when he siaughtered V&#7771;tra, when he defeated &#346;ambara's many onslaughts, and battered down his nineand ninety ramparts.</p><p>This stirreth up my voice when I have drunk it: this hath aroused from sleep my yearning spirit. This Sage hath measured out the six expanses from which no single creature is excluded.</p><p>This, even this, is he who hath created the breadth of Earth, the lofty height of Heaven. He formed the nectar in three headlong rivers. Soma supports the wide mid-air above us.</p><p>He found the wavy sea of brilliant colours in forefront of the Dawns who dwell in brightness. This Mighty One, the Steer begirt by Devas, hath propped the heavens up with a mighty pillar.</p><p>Drink Soma boldly from the beaker, Indra, in war for treasures, Hero, V&#7771;tra-slayer! Fill thyself full at the mid-day libation, and give us wealth, thou Treasury of riches.</p><p>Look out for us, O Indra, as our Leader, and guide us on to gain yet goodlier treasure. Excellent Guardian, bear us well through peril, and lead us on to wealth with careful guidance.</p><p>Lead us to ample room, O thou who knowest, to happiness, security, and sunlight. High, Indra, are the arms of thee the Mighty. May we betake. us to their lofty shelter.</p><p>Set us on widest chariot-seat, O Indra, with two steeds best to draw, O Lord of Hundreds! Bring us the best among all sorts of offerings: let not the foe's wealth, Indra, subdue us.</p><p>Be gracious, Indra, let my days be lengthened: sharpen my thought as &#146;twere a blade of iron Approve whatever words I speak, dependent on thee, and grant me thy divine protection.</p><p>Indra the Rescuer, Indra the Helper, Hero who listens at each invocation, &#346;akra I call, Indra invoked of many. May Indra Indra prosper and bless us.</p><p>May helpful Indra as our good Protector, Lord of all treasures, favour us with succour, Baffle our foes, and give us rest and safety, an. May we be the lords of hero vigour.</p><p>May we enjoy the grace of him the Holy, yea. May we dwell in his auspicious favour. May helpful Indra as our good Preserver drive from us, even from afar, our foemen.</p><p>Like rivers rushing down a slope, O Indra, to thee haste songs and prayers and linked verses. Thou gatherest, Thunderer! like widespread bounty, kine, water, drops, and manifold libations.</p><p>Who lauds him, satisfies him, pays him worship? E&#146;en the rich noble still hath found him mighty. With power, as when one moves his feet alternate, he makes the last precede, the foremost follow.</p><p>Famed is the Hero as each strong man's tamer, ever advancing one and then another. King of both worlds, hating the high and haughty, Indra protects the men who are his people.</p><p>He loves no more the men he loved aforetime: he turns and moves away allied with others. Rejecting those who disregard his worship, Indra victorious lives through many autumns.</p><p>In every figure he hath been the mode: this is his only form for us to look on. Indra moves multiform by his illusions; for his Bay Steeds are yoked, ten times a hundred.</p><p>Here Tva&#7779;&#7789;ar, yoking to the car the Bay Steeds, hath extended sway. Who will forever stand upon the foeman's side, even when our princes sit at ease?</p><p>Devas, we have reached a country void of pasture the land, though spacious, was too small to hold us. B&#7771;haspati, provide in war for cattle; find a path, Indra, for this faithful singer.</p><p>Day after day far from their seat he drove them, alike, from place to place, those darksome creatures. The Hero slew the meanly-huckstering D&#257;sas, Varcin and &#346;ambara, where the waters gather.</p><p>Out of thy bounty, Indra, hath Prastoka bestowed ten coffers and ten mettled horses. We have received in turn from Divod&#257;sa &#346;ambara's wealth, the gift of Atithigva.</p><p>Ten horses and ten treasure-chests, ten garments as an added gift, these and ten lumps of gold have I received from Divod&#257;sa's hand.</p><p>Ten cars with extra steed to each, for the Atharvans hundred cows, Hath Asvatha to Payu given.</p><p>Thus S&#7771;&ntilde;jaya's son honoured the Bharadv&#257;jas, recipients of all noble gifts and bounty.</p><p>Lord of the wood, be firm and strong in body: be, bearing us, a brave victorious hero Show forth thy strength, compact with straps of leather, and let thy rider win all spoils of battle.</p><p>Its mighty strength was borrowed from the Heaven and Earth: its conquering force was brought from sovrans of the wood. Honour with holy gifts the Car like Indra's bolt, the Car bound round with straps, the vigour of the floods.</p><p>Thou Bolt of Indra, Vanguard of the Devas, close knit to Varu&#7751;a and Child of Mitra,&#151; As such, accepting gifts which here we offer, receive, O Godlike Chariot, these oblations.</p><p>Send forth thy voice aloud through Earth and Heaven, and let the world in all its breadth regard thee; O Drum, accordant with the Devas and Indra, drive thou afar, yea, very far, our foemen.</p><p>Thunder out strength and fill us full of vigour: yea, thunder forth and drive away all dangers. Drive hence, O War-drum, drive away misfortune: thou art the Fist of Indra: show thy firmness.</p><p>Drive hither those, and these again bring hither: the War-drum speaks aloud as battle's signal. Our heroes, winged with horses, come together. Let our car-warriors, Indra, be triumphant.</p>
