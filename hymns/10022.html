<div class="box hymn"><p>WHERE is famed Indra heard of? With what folk is he renowned to-day as Mitra is. Who in the home of Ṛṣis and in secret is extolled with song?</p><p>Even here is Indra famed, and among us this day the glorious Thunderer is praised. He who like Mitra mid the folk hath won complete and full renown.</p><p>He who is Sovran Lord of great and perfect strength, exerter of heroic might, who bears the fearless thunder as a father bears his darling son.</p><p>Harnessing to thy car, as Deva, two blustering Steeds Of the Wind-Deva, O Thunderer, that speed along the shining path, thou making ways art glorified.</p><p>Even to these dark Steeds of Wind thou of thyself hast come to ride, Of which no drive. May be found, none, be he Deva or mortal man.</p><p>When ye approach, men ask you, thee and Uśanā: Why come ye to our dwelling-place? Why are ye come to mortal man from distant realms of eapth and Heaven?</p><p>O Indra, thou shalt speak us fair: our holy prayer is offered up.</p><p>We meditate to thee for help as thou didst strike the monster Śuṣṇa dead.</p><p>Around us is the Dasyu, riteless, void of sense, inhuman, keeping alien laws. Baffle, thou Slayer of the foe, the weapon which this Dāsa wields.</p><p>Hero with Heroes, thou art ours: yea, strong are they whom thou dost help. In many a place are thy full gifts, and men, like vassals, sing thy praise.</p><p>Urge thou these heroes on to subdue the enemy, brave Thunderer! in the fight with swords. Even when hid among the tribes of Sages numerous as stars.</p><p>Swift come those gifts of thine whose hand is prompt to rend and burn, O Hero Thunder-armed: As thou with thy Companions didst destroy the whole of SuSnia's brood.</p><p>Let not thine excellent assistance come to us, O Hero Indra, profitless. May we. May we enjoy the bliss of these thy favours, Thunderer!</p><p>May those soft impulses of thine, O Indra, be fruitful and innocent to us. May we know these whose treasures are like those of milch-kine, Thunderer!</p><p>That Earth, through power of knowing things tha. May be known, handless and footless yet might thrive, Thou slewest, turning to the right, gu;na forevery living man.</p><p>Drink, drink the Soma. Hero Indra; be not withheld as thou art good, O Treasure-giver. Preserve the singers and our liberal princes, and make us wealthy with abundant riches.</p>
