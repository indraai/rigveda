<h1>HYMN XLI. Devas.</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>NE’ER is he injured whom the Devas, the excellently wise, protect.</p><p>He prospers ever, free from scathe, whom they, as with full hands, enrich, whom they preserve from every foe.</p><p>The Kings drive far away from him his troubles and his enemies, and lead him safely o’er distress.</p><p>Thornless Devas is the path, easy for him who seeks the Law: With him is naught to anger you.</p><p>What offeringye Heroes guide by the path direct,— May that come nigh unto your thought.</p><p>That mortal, ever unsubdued, gains wealth and every precious thing, and children also of his own.</p><p>How, my friends, shall we prepare glorious food?</p><p>I point not out to you a man who strikes the pious, or reviles: Only with hymns I call you nigh.</p><p>Let him not love to speak ill words: but fear the One who holds all four within his hand, until they fall.</p>
