<h1>HYMN XXI. Indra.</h1>
<p>MAY Indra come to us for our protection;</p>
</section>
<main>
<p>MAY Indra come to us for our protection; here be the Hero, praised, our feast-companion.</p><p>May he whose powers are many, waxen mighty, cherish, like Devas, his own supreme dominion.</p><p>Here magnify his great heroic exploits, most glorious One, enriching men with bounties, whose will is like a Sovran in assembly, who rules the people, Conqueror, all-surpassing.</p><p>Hither let Indra come from Earth or Heaven, hither with speech from Firmament or ocean; With Devas, from the realm of light to aid us, or from a distance, from the seat of Order.</p><p>That Indra will we laud in our assemblies, him who is Lord of great and lasting riches, Victor with V&#257;yu where the herds are gathered, who leads with boldness on to higher fortune.</p><p>May the Monk, Lord of many blessings, striving,&#151;who fixing reverence on reverence, giving Vent to his voice, inciteth men to worship&#151;with lauds bring Indra hither to our dwellings.</p><p>When sitting pondering in deep devotion in Au&#347;ija's abode they ply the press-stone, May he whose wrath is fierce, the mighty bearer, come as the house-lord's priest within our chambers.</p><p>Surely the power of Bh&#257;rvara the mighty forever helpeth to support the singer; That which in Au&#347;ija's abode lies hidden, to come forth for delight and for devotion.</p><p>When he unbars the spaces of the mountains, and quickens with his floods the water-torrents, He finds in lair the buffalo and wild-ox when the wise lead him on to vigorous exploit.</p><p>Auspicious are thy hands, thine arms well-fashioned which proffer bounty, Indra, to thy praiser. What sloth is this? Why dost thou not rejoice thee? Why dost thou not delight thyself with giving?</p><p>So Indra is the truthful Lord of treasure. Freedom he gave to man by subduing V&#7771;tra. Much-lauded! help us with thy power to riches. May I be sharer of thy Godlike favour.</p><p>Now, Indra! lauded, glorified with praises, let power swell high, like rivers, for the singer. For thee a new hymn, Lord of Bays! is fashioned. May we, care-borne, through song be victors ever.</p>
