<h2>HYMN XV. Indra</h2>

<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>Now, verily, will I declare the exploits, mighty and true, of him the True and Mighty.</p><p>In the Trikadrukas he drank the Soma: then in its rapture Indra slew the Dragon.</p><p>High Heaven unsupported in space he stablished: he filled the two worlds and the air's mid-region. Earth he upheld, and gave it wide expansion. These things did Indra in the Soma's rapture.</p><p>From front, as &#146;twere a house, he ruled and measured; pierced with his bolt the fountains of the rivers, and made them flow at ease by paths far-reaching, these things did Indra in the Soma's rapture.</p><p>Compassing those who bore away Dabh&#299;ti, in kindled fire he burnt up all their weapons. And made him rich with kine and cars and horses. These things did Indra in the Soma's rapture.</p><p>The mighty roaring flood he stayed from flowing, and carried those who swam not safely over. They having crossed the stream attained to riches. These things did Indra in the Soma's rapture.</p><p>With mighty power he made the stream flow upward, crushed with his thunderbolt the car of U&#7779;as, Rending her slow steeds with his rapid coursers. These things did Indra in the Soma's rapture.</p><p>Knowing the place wherein the maids were hiding, the outcast showed himself and stood before them. The cripple stood erect, the blind beheld them. These things did Indra in the Soma's rapture.</p><p>Praised by the A&#7749;girases he slaughtered Vala, and burst apart the bulwarks of the mountain. He tore away their deftly-built defences. These things did Indra in the Soma's rapture.</p><p>Thou, with sleep whelming Cumuri and Dhuni, slewest the Dasyu, keptest safe Dabh&#299;ti. There the staff-bearer found the golden treasure. These things did Indra in the Soma's rapture.</p><p>Now let that wealthy Cow of thine, O Indra , yield in return a boon to him who lauds thee. Give to thy praisers: let not fortune fail us. Lou. May we speak, with brave men, in assembly.</p>
