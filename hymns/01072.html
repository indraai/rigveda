<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>THOUGH holding many gifts for men, he humbleth the higher powers of each wise ordainer.</p><p>Agni is now the treasure-lord of treasures, forever granting all immortal bounties.</p><p>The Devas infallible all searching found not him, the dear Babe who still is round about us. Worn weary, following his track, devoted, they reached the lovely highest home of Agni.</p><p>Because with holy oil the pure Ones, Agni, served thee the very pure three autumn seasons, therefore they won them holy names for worship, and nobly born they dignified their bodies.</p><p>Making them known to spacious Earth and Heaven, the holy Ones revealed the powers of Soma. The mortal band, discerning in the distance, found Agni standing in the loftiest station.</p><p>Nigh they approached, one-minded, with their spouses, kneeling to him adorable paid worship. Friend finding in his own friend's eye protection, they made their own the bodies which they chastened.</p><p>Soon as the holy beings had discovered the thrice-seven mystic things contained within thee, with these, one-minded, they preserve the Am·πõta: guard thou the life of all their plants and cattle.</p><p>Thou, Agni, knower of men's works, hast sent us good food in constant course for our subsistence: Thou deeply skilled in paths of Devas becamest an envoy never wearied, offering-bearer.</p><p>Knowing the Law, the seven strong floods from Heaven, full of good thought, discerned the doors of riches. SaramƒÅ found the cattle's firm-built prison whereby the race of man is still supported.</p><p>They who approached all noble operations making a path that leads to life immortal, to be the Bird's support, the spacious mother, Aditi, and her great Sons stood in power.</p><p>When Devas immortal made both eyes of Heaven, they gave to him the gift of beauteous glory. Now they flow forth like rivers set in motion: they knew the Red Steeds coming down, O Agni.</p>
