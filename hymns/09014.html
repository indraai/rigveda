<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>REPOSING on the river's wave the Sage hath widely flowed around, bearing the hymn which many love.</p><p>When the Five kindred Companies, active in duty, with the song Establish him, the Powerful,</p><p>Then in his juice whose strength is great, have all the Devas rejoiced themselves, when he hath clothed him in the milk.</p><p>Freeing himself he flows away, leaving his body's severed limbs, and meets his own Companion here.</p><p>He by the daughters of the priest, like a fair youth, hath been adorned, Making the milk, as &#146;twere, his robe.</p><p>O'er the fine fingers, through desire of milk, in winding course he goes, and utters voice which he hath found.</p><p>The nimble fingers have approached, adorning him the Lord of Strength: They grasp the vigorous Courser's back.</p><p>Comprising all the treasures that are in the heavens and on the Earth, Come, Soma, as our faithful Friend.</p>
