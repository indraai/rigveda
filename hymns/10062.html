<p>YE, who, adorned with guerdon through the offering, have won you Indra's friendship and eternal life, Even to you be happiness, A&#7749;girases. Welcome the son of Manu, ye who are most wise.</p><p>The Fathers, who drave forth the wealth in cattle, have in the year's courses cleft Vala by Eternal Law: A lengthened life be yours, O ye A&#7749;girases. Welcome the son of Manu, ye who are most wise.</p><p>Ye raised the Sun to Heaven by everlasting Law, and spread broad Earth, the Mother, out on every side.</p><p>Fair wealth of progeny be yours, A&#7749;girases. Welcome the son of Manu, ye who are most wise.</p><p>This kinsman in your dwellingplace speaks pleasant words: give car to this, ye &#7770;&#7779;is, children of the Devas. High Brahman dignity be yours, A&#7749;girases. Welcome the son of Manu, ye who are most wise.</p><p>Distinguished by their varied form, these &#7770;&#7779;is have been deeply moved. These are the sons of A&#7749;girases: from Agni have they sprung to life.</p><p>Distinguished by their varied form, they sprang from Agni, from the sky. Navagva and Da&#347;agva, noblest A&#7749;giras, he giveth bounty with the Devas.</p><p>With Indra for associate the monks have cleared the stable full of steeds and kine, giving to me a thousand with their eightmarked cars, they gained renown among the Devas.</p><p>May this man's sons be multiplied; like springing cor. May Manu grow, who gives at once in bounteous gift a thousand kine, a hundred steeds.</p><p>No one attains to him, as though a man would grasp the heights of Heaven. Savarnya's sacrificial meed hath broadened like an ample flood.</p><p>Yadu and Turva, too, have given two D&#257;sas, well-disposed, to serve, together with great store of kine.</p><p>Blest be the hamlet's chief, most liberal Manu, an. May his bounty rival that of S&#363;rya. May the Deva let Ssvarni's life be leng thened, with whom, unwearied, we have lived and prospered.</p>
