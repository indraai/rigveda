<h2>HYMN XXXII. Indra.</h2>

<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>I WILL declare the manly deeds of Indra, the first that he achieved, the Thunder-wielder.</p><p>He  disclosed the waters, and cleft the channels of the mountain torrents.</p><p>His heavenly bolt of thunder Tva&#7779;&#7789;ar fashioned. Like lowing kine in rapid flow descending the waters glided downward to the ocean.</p><p>Indra grasped the thunder for his weapon, and smote to death this firstborn of the dragons.</p><p>When, Indra overcome the charms of the enchanters, then, giving life to Sun and Dawn and Heaven, thou foundest not one foe to stand against thee.</p><p>Indra with his own great and deadly thunder smote into pieces V&#7771;tra, worst of V&#7771;tras. As trunks of trees, what time the axe hath felled them, low on the Earth so lies the prostrate Dragon.</p><p>He, challenged Indra, the great impetuous many-subduing Hero. He, brooking not the clashing of the weapons, crushed&#151;Indra's foe&#151;the shattered forts in falling.</p><p>Footless and handless still he challenged Indra, who smote him with his bolt between the shoulders. Emasculate yet claiming manly vigour, thus V&#7771;tra lay.</p><p>There as he lies like a bank-bursting river, the waters taking courage flow above him. The Dragon lies beneath the feet of torrents which V&#7771;tra with his greatness had encompassed.</p><p>Then humbled was the strength of V&#7771;tra's mother. The mother was above, the son was under and like a cow beside her calf lay Danu.</p><p>Rolled in the midst of never-ceasing currents flowing without a rest forever onward. The waters bear off V&#7771;tra's nameless body: the foe of Indra sank to during darkness.</p><p>Guarded by Ahi stood the thralls of D&#257;sas, the waters stayed like kine held by the robber. But he, when he had smitten V&#7771;tra, opened the cave wherein the floods had been imprisoned.</p><p>A horse's tail wast thou when he, O Indra, smote on thy bolt; thou, God without a second, Thou hast won back the kine, thou hast let loose to flow the Seven Rivers.</p><p>Nothing availed him lightning, nothing thunder, hailstorm or mist which had spread around him: When Indra and the Dragon strove in battle, Indra gained the victory forever.</p><p>Whom sawest thou to avenge the Dragon, Indra, that fear possessed thy heart when thou hadst slain him; That, like a hawk affrighted through the regions, thou crossedst nine-and-ninety flowing rivers?</p><p>Indra is King of all that moves and moves not, of creatures tame and horned, the Thunder-wielder. Over all living men he rules as Sovran, containing all as spokes within the felly.</p>
