<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>O HEROES lordliest of all, who are ye that have singly come Forth from a region most remote?</p><p>Where are your horses, where the reins? How came ye? how had ye the power? Rein was on nose and seat on back.</p><p>The whip is laid upon the flank. The heroes stretch their thighs apart, like women when the babe is born.</p><p>Go ye, O Heroes, far away, ye bridegrooms with a lovely Spouse That y. May warm you at the fire.</p><p>May she gain cattle for her meed, hundreds of sheep and steeds and kine, who threw embracing arms around the hero whom gyavaiva praised.</p><p>Yea, many a woman is more firm and better than the man who turns Away from Devas, andoffers not.</p><p>She who discerns the weak and worn, the man who thirsts and is in want She sets her mind upon the Devas.</p><p>And yet full many a one, unpraised, mean niggard, is entitled man: Only in weregild is he such.</p><p>And she, the young, the joyous-spirited, divulged the path to &#346;y&#257;va, yea, to me.</p><p>Two red steeds carried me to Purum&#299;lha's side, that sage of far-extended fame,</p><p>Him who, like Vaidadasvi, like Taranta, hath bestowed on me A hundred cows in liberal gift.</p><p>They who are borne by rapid steeds, drinking the meath that gives delight, they have attained high glories here.</p><p>They by whose splendour both the worlds are over-spread they shine on cars As the gold gleams above in Heaven.</p><p>That Marut band is ever young, borne on bright cars, unblamable, Moving to victory, checked by none.</p><p>Who knoweth, verily, of these where the All-shakers take delight, Born, spotless, after sacred Law?</p><p>Guides are ye, lovers of the song to mortal man through holy hymn, and hearers when he cries for help.</p><p>Do ye, destroyers of the foe, worshipful and exceeding bright, Send down the treasures that we crave.</p><p>OUrmya, bear thou far away to Darbhya this my hymn of praise, Songs, Goddess, as if chariot-borne.</p><p>From me to Rathaviti say, when he hath pressed the Soma juice, the wish I had departeth not.</p><p>This wealthy Rathaviti dwells among the people rich in kine, Among the mountains, far withdrawn.</p>
