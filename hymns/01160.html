<h1>HYMN CLX. Heaven and Earth.</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>THESE, Heaven and Earth, bestow prosperity on all, sustainers of the region, Holy Ones and wise, Two Bowls of noble kind: between these Goddesses the Deva, the fulgent Sun, travels by fixed decree.</p><p>Widely-capacious Pair, mighty, that never fail, the Father and the Mother keep all creatures safe: The two world-halves, the spirited, the beautiful, because the Father hath clothed them in goodly forms.</p><p>Son of these Parents, he the Monk with power to cleanse, Sage, sanctifies the worlds with his surpassing power.</p><p>Thereto for his bright milk he milked through all the days the party-coloured Cow and the prolific Bull.</p><p>Among the skilful Devas most skilled is he, who made the two world-halves which bring prosperity to all; Who with great wisdom measured both the regions out, and stablished them with pillars that shall neâ€™er decay.</p><p>Extolled in song, O Heaven and Earth, bestow on us, ye mighty Pair, great glory and high lordly sway, Whereby we may extend ourselves ever over the folk; and send us strength that shall deserve the praise of men.</p>
