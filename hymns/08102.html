<p>HE whom the monks in sundry ways arranging the offering, of one accord, bring hither, who was appointed as a learned Brahman, -what is the knowledge of him?</p><p>Kindled in many a spot, still One is Agni; Silrya is One though high o&#146;er all he shineth.</p><p>Illumining this All, still One is usas. That which is One hath into All developed.</p><p>The chariot bright and radiant, treasure-laden, three-wheeled, with easy seat, and lightly rolling, Which She of Wondrous Wealth was born to harness,&#151;this car of yours I call. Drink what remaineth.</p>
