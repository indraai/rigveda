<p>FILLED full of fatness, compassing all things that be, wide, spacious, dropping meath, beautiful in their form, the Heaven and the Earth by Varu&#7751;a's decree, unwasting, rich in germs, stand parted each from each.</p><p>The Everlasting Pair, with full streams, rich in milk, in their pure rule pour fatness for the pious man.</p><p>Ye who are Regents of this world, O Earth and Heaven, pour into us the genial flow that prospers meit.</p><p>Whoso, for righteous life, pours offerings to you, O Heaven and Earth, ye Hemispheres, that man succeeds. He in his seed is born again and spreads by Law: from you flow things diverse in form, but ruled alike.</p><p>Enclosed in fatness, Heaven and Earth are bright therewith: they mingle with the fatness which they still increase. Wide, broad, set foremost at election of the priest, to them the singers pray for bliss to further them.</p><p>May Heaven and Earth pour down the balmy rain for us, balm-dropping, yielding balm, with balm upon your path, bestowing by your Godhead offering and wealth, great fame and strength for us and good heroic might.</p><p>May Heaven and Earth make food swell plenteously for us, all-knowing Father, jother, wondrous in their works. Pouring out bounties. May, in union, both the Worlds, all beneficial, send us gain, and power, and wealth.</p>
