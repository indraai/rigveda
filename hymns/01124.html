<h1>HYMN CXXIV. Dawn.</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>THE Dawn refulgent when the fire is kindled, and the Sun rising, far diffuse their brightness.</p><p>Indra, Deva, hath sent us forth to labour, each quadruped, each biped, to be active.</p><p>Not interrupting heavenly ordinances, although she minisheth human generations. The last of endless morns that have departed, the first of those that come, Dawn brightly shineth.</p><p>There in the eastern region she, Heaven's Daughter, arrayed in garments all of light, appeareth. Truly she followeth the path of Order, nor faileth, knowing well, the heavenly quarters.</p><p>Near is she seen, as ’twere the Bright One's bosom: she showeth sweet things like a new song-singer. She cometh like a fly awaking sleepers, of all returning dames most true and constant.</p><p>There in the east half of the watery region the Mother of the Cows hath shown her ensign. Wider and wider still she spreadeth onward, and filleth full the laps of both heir Parents.</p><p>She, verily, exceeding vast to look on debarreth from her light nor kin nor stranger. Proud of her spotless form she, brightly shining, turneth not from the high nor from the humble.</p><p>She seeketh men, as she who hath no brother, mounting her car, as ’twere to gather riches. Dawn, like a loving matron for her husband, smiling and well attired, unmasks her beauty.</p><p>The Sister quitteth, for the elder Sister, her place, and having looked on her departeth. She decks her beauty, shining forth with sunbeams, like women trooping to the festal meeting.</p><p>To all these Sisters who ere now have vanished a later on each day in course succeedeth. So, like the past, with days of happy fortune. May the new Dawns shine forth on us with riches.</p><p>Rouse up, O Wealthy One, the liberal givers; let niggard traffickers sleep on unwakened: Shine richly, Wealthy One, on those who worship, richly, glad. Dawn while wasting, on the singer.</p><p>This young Maid from the east hath shone upon us; she harnesseth her team of bright red oxen. She will beam forth, the light will hasten hither, and Agni will be present in each dwelling.</p><p>As the birds fly forth from their resting places, so men with store of food rise at thy dawning. Yea, to the liberal mortal who remaineth at home, O Goddess Dawn, much good thou bringest.</p><p>Praised through my meditation be ye who should be lauded. Ye have increased our wealth, ye Dawns who love us. Goddesses. May we win by your good favour wealth to be told by hundreds and by thousands.</p>
