<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>STRONG are the Somas; come thou nigh; these offerings have been mixt with milk: Drink, V&#257;yu, the presented draughts.</p><p>Both Deities who touch the Heaven, Indra and V&#257;yu we invoke to drink of this our Soma juice.</p><p>The singers' for their aid, invoke Indra and V&#257;yu, swift as mind, the thousand-eyed, the Lords of thought.</p><p>Mitra and Varu&#7751;a, renowned as Devas of consecrated might, We call  juice.</p><p>Those who by Law uphold the Law, Lords of the shining light of Law, Mitra I call, and Varu&#7751;a.</p><p>Let Varu&#7751;a be our chief defence, let Mitra guard us with all aids Both make us rich exceedingly.</p><p>Indra, by Devas girt, we call  juice. May he Sate him in union with his troop.</p><p>Devas, hosts whom Indra leads, distributers of P&#363;&#7779;an's gifts. Hearken ye all unto my cry.</p><p>With conquering Indra for ally. Let not the wicked master us.</p><p>We call the Universal Devas, and DevasH, for passing strong are P&#7771;&#347;ni's Sons.</p><p>Fierce comes the Devas&#146; thundering voice, like that of conquerors, when ye go Forward to victory, O Men.</p><p>Born of the laughing lightning. May the Devas guard us everywhere May they be gracious unto Us.</p><p>Like some lost animal, drive to us, bright P&#363;&#7779;an, him who bears up Heaven, Resting on many-coloured grass.</p><p>P&#363;&#7779;an the Bright has found the King, concealed and hidden in a cave, who rests on grass of many hues.</p><p>An. May he. duly bring to me the six bound closely, through these drops, as one who ploughs with steers brings corn.</p><p>Along their paths the Mothers go, Sisters of priestly ministrants, Mingling their sweetness with the milk.</p><p>May Waters gathered near the Sun, and those wherewith the Sun is joined. Speed forth this offering of ours.</p><p>I call the Waters wherein our cattle quench their thirst; Oblations to the Streams be given.</p><p>Amrit is in the Waters. In the Waters there is healing balm be swift to give them praise.</p><p>Within the Waters dwell all balms that heal. The Waters hold all medicines.</p><p>O Waters, teem with medicine to keep my body safe from harm. So that I lon. May see the Sun.</p><p>Whatever sin is found in me, whatever evil I have wrought.</p><p>If I have lied or falsely sworn, Waters, remove it far from me.</p><p>The Waters I this day have sought, and to their moisture have we come: O Agni, rich in milk, come thou, and with thy splendour cover me.</p><p>Fill me with splendour, give offspring and length of days. Know me even as I am, and Indra with the &#7770;&#7779;is, know.</p>
