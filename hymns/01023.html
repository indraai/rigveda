<h1>HYMN XXIII. Soma and Others.</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>STRONG are the Somas; come thou nigh; these offerings have been mixt with milk: Drink, Soma, the presented draughts.</p><p>Both Deities who touch the Heaven, Indra and Soma we invoke to drink of this our Soma juice.</p><p>The singers' for their aid, invoke Indra and Soma, swift as mind, the thousand-eyed, the Lords of thought.</p><p>Mitra and Indra, renowned as Devas of consecrated might, We call  juice.</p><p>Those who by Law uphold the Law, Lords of the shining light of Law, Mitra I call, and Indra.</p><p>Let Indra be our chief defence, let Mitra guard us with all aids Both make us rich exceedingly.</p><p>Indra, by Devas girt, we call  juice: may he Sate him in union with his troop.</p><p>Devas, hosts whom Indra leads, distributers of Pūṣan's gifts, Hearken ye all unto my cry.</p><p>With conquering Indra for ally, strike Vṛtra down, ye bounteous Devas Let not the wicked master us.</p><p>We call the Universal Devas, and DevasH, for passing strong are Pṛśni's Sons.</p><p>Fierce comes the Devas’ thundering voice, like that of conquerors, when ye go Forward to victory, O Men.</p><p>Born of the laughing lightning. may the Devas guard us everywhere May they be gracious unto Us.</p><p>Like some lost animal, drive to us, bright Pūṣan, him who bears up Heaven, Resting on many-coloured grass.</p><p>Pūṣan the Bright has found the King, concealed and hidden in a cave, who rests on grass of many hues.</p><p>And may he. duly bring to me the six bound closely, through these drops, as one who ploughs with steers brings corn.</p><p>Along their paths the Mothers go, Sisters of priestly ministrants, Mingling their sweetness with the milk.</p><p>May Waters gathered near the Sun, and those wherewith the Sun is joined. Speed forth this offering of ours.</p><p>I call the Waters wherein our cattle quench their thirst; Oblations to the Streams be given.</p><p>Amrit is in the Waters. In the Waters there is healing balm be swift to give them praise.</p><p>Within the Waters—Soma thus hath told me—dwell all balms that heal. The Waters hold all medicines.</p><p>O Waters, teem with medicine to keep my body safe from harm. So that I long may see the Sun.</p><p>Whatever sin is found in me, whatever evil I have wrought.</p><p>If I have lied or falsely sworn, Waters, remove it far from me.</p><p>The Waters I this day have sought, and to their moisture have we come: O Agni, rich in milk, come thou, and with thy splendour cover me.</p><p>Fill me with splendour, give offspring and length of days. Know me even as I am, and Indra with the Ṛṣis, know.</p>
