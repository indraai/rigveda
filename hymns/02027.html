<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>THESE hymns that drop down fatness, with the ladle I ever offer to the Kings &#256;dityas.</p><p>May Mitra, Aryaman, and Bhaga hear us, the mighty Varu&#7751;a Dak&#7779;a, and A&#7745;&#347;a.</p><p>With one accor. May Aryaman and Mitra and Varu&#7751;a this day accept this praise-song&#151; &#256;dityas bright and pure as streams of water, free from all guile and falsehood, blameless, perfect.</p><p>These Devas, &#256;dityas, vast, profound, and faithful, with many eyes, fain to deceive the wicked, Looking within behold the good and evil near to the Kings is even the thing most distant.</p><p>Upholding that which moves and that which moves not, &#256;dityas, Devas, protectors of all being, Provident, guarding well the world of spirits, true to eternal Law, the debt-exactors.</p><p>May I, &#256;dityas, share m this your favour which, Aryaman, brings profit e&#146;en in danger. Under your guidance, Varu&#7751;a and Mitra, round trouble. May I pass, like rugged places.</p><p>Smooth is your path, O Aryaman and Mitra; excellent is it, Varu&#7751;a, and thornless. Thereon, &#256;dityas, send us down your blessing: grant us a shelter hard to be demolished.</p><p>Mother of Kings. May Aditi transport us, by fair paths Aryaman, beyond all hatred. May we uninjured, girt by many heroes, win Varu&#7751;a's and Mitra's high protection.</p><p>With their support they stay three earths, three heavens; three are their functions in the Devas&#146; assembly. Mighty through Law, &#256;dityas, is your greatness; fair is it, Aryaman, Varu&#7751;a, and Mitra.</p><p>Golden and splendid, pure like streams of water, they hold aloft the three bright heavenly regions. Ne&#146;er do they slumber, never close their eyelids, faithful, far-ruling for the righteous mortal.</p><p>Thou over all, O Varu&#7751;a, art Sovran, be they Devas, Devas! or be they mortals. Grant unto us to see a hundred autumns ours be the blest long lives of our forefathers.</p><p>Neither the right nor left do I distinguish, neither the cast nor yet the west, &#256;dityas. Simple and guided by your wisdom, Devas. May I attain the light that brings no danger.</p><p>He who bears gifts unto the Kings, true Leaders, he whom their everlasting blessings prosper, Moves with his chariot first in rank and wealthy, munificent and lauded in assemblies.</p><p>Pure, faithful, very strong, with heroes round him, he dwells beside the waters rich with pasture. None subdues, from near at hand or from a distance, him who is under the &#256;dityas&#146; guidance.</p><p>Aditi, Mitra, Varu&#7751;a, forgive us however we have erred and sinned against you. May I obtain the broad light free from peril: O Indra, let not during darkness seize us.</p><p>For him the Twain united pour their fulness, the rain from Heaven: he thrives most highly favoured. He goes to war mastering both the mansions: to him both portions of the world are gracious.</p><p>Your guiles, ye Holy Ones, to quell oppressors, your snares spread out against the foe, &#256;dityas, May I car-borne pass like a skilful horseman: uninjure. May we dwell in spacious shelter.</p><p>May I not live, O Varu&#7751;a, to witness my wealthy, liberal, dear friend's destitution. King. May O never lack well-ordered riches. Lou. May we speak, with heroes, in assembly.</p>
