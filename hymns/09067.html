<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>THOU, Soma, hast a running stream, joyous, most strong at offering: Flow bounteously bestowing wealth.</p><p>Effused as cheerer of the men, flowing best gladdener, thou art A Prince to Indra with thy juice.</p><p>Poured forth by pressing-stones, do thou with loud roar send us in a stream Most excellent illustrious might.</p><p>Indu, urged forward, floweth through the fleecy cloth: the Tawny One With his loud roar hath brought as strength.</p><p>Indu, thou flowest through the fleece, bringing felicities and fame, and, Soma, spoil and wealth in kine.</p><p>Hither, O Indu, bring us wealth in steeds and cattle hundredfold: Bring wealth, O Soma, thousandfold.</p><p>In purifying, through the sieve the rapid drops of'Soma juice Come nigh to Indra in their course.</p><p>For Indra floweth excellent Indu, the noblest Soma juice The Living for the Living One.</p><p>The glittering maids send S&#363;ra forth they with their song have sung aloud To Pavamana dropping meath.</p><p>May P&#363;&#7779;an, drawn by goats, be our protector, and on all his paths Bestow on us our share of maids.</p><p>This Soma flows like gladdening oil for him who wears the braided locks: He shall give us our share of maids.</p><p>This Soma juice, O glowing Deva, flows like pure oil, effused for thee: He shall give us our share of maids.</p><p>Flow onward, Soma, in thy stream, begetter of the sages' speech: Wealth-giver among Devas art thou.</p><p>The Falcon dips within the jars: he wrap&#7717;im in his robe and goes Loud roaring to the vats of wood.</p><p>Soma, thy juice hath been effused and poured into the pitcher: like a rapid hawk it rushes on.</p><p>For Indra flow most rich in sweets, O Soma, bringing him delight.</p><p>They were sent forth to feast the Devas, like chariots that display their strength.</p><p>Brilliant, best givers of delight, these offerings have sent V&#257;yu forth.</p><p>Bruised by the press-stones and extolled, Soma, thou goest to the sieve, giving the worshipper hero strength.</p><p>This juice bruised by the pressing-stones and lauded passes through the sieve, Slayer of demons, through the fleece.</p><p>O Pavamana, drive away the danger, whether near at hand Or far remote, that finds me here.</p><p>This da. May Pavamana cleanse us with his purifying power, most active purifying Monk.</p><p>O Agni, with the cleansing light diffused through all thy fiery glow, Purify thou this prayer of ours.</p><p>Cleanse us with thine own cleansing power, O Agni, that is bright with flame, and by libations poured to thee.</p><p>Indra, Deva, by both of these, libation, purifying power, Purify me on every side.</p><p>Cleanse us, God Indra, with Three, O Soma, with sublimest forms, Agni, with forms of power and might.</p><p>May the Devas&#146; company make me clean, and Devas make rue pure by song.</p><p>Purify me, ye General Devas; O J&#257;tavedas, make me pure.</p><p>Fill thyself full of juice, flow forth, O Soma, thou with all thy stalks, the best oblation to the Devas.</p><p>We with our homage have approached the Friend who seeks our wondering praise, Young, strengthener of the solemn rite.</p><p>Lost is Alayya's axe. O Soma, God do thou send it back hither in thy flow Even, Soma, Deva, if &#146;twere a mole.</p><p>The man who reads the essence stored by saints, the Pavamani hymns, Tastes food completely purified, made sweet by M&#257;tari&#347;van's touch.</p><p>Whoever reads the essence stored by saints, the Pavamani hymns, Sarasvat&#299; draws forth for him water and butter, milk and meath.</p>
