<h2>HYMN II. Indra.</h2>

<div class="box hymn"><p>HERE is the Soma juice expressed; O Vasu, drink till thou art full: Undaunted Deva, we give it thee.</p><p>Washed by the men, pressed out with stones, strained through the filter made of wool, ‚ÄôTis like a courser bathed in stream.</p><p>This juice have we made sweet for thee like barley, blending it with milk.</p><p>Indra, I call thee to our feast.</p><p>Beloved of all, Indra alone drinks up the flowing Soma juice Among the Devas and mortal men.</p><p>The Friend, whom not the brilliant-hued, the badly-mixt or bitter draught, Repels, the far-extending Deva;</p><p>While other men than we with milk chase him as hunters chase a deer, and with their kine inveigle him.</p><p>For him, for Indra, for the Deva, be pressed three draughts of Soma juice In the juice-drinker's own abode.</p><p>Three reservoirs exude their drops, filled are three beakers to the brim, All for one offering to the Deva.</p><p>Pure art thou, set in many a place, and blended in the midst with milk And curd, to cheer the Hero best.</p><p>Here, Indra, are thy Soma-draughts pressed out by us, the strong, the pure: They crave admixture of the milk.</p><p>O Indra, pour in milk, prepare the cake, and mix the Soma-draught. I hear them say that thou art rich.</p><p>Quaffed juices fight within the breast. The drunken praise not by their wine, the naked praise not when it rains.</p><p>Rich be the praiser of one rich, munificent and famed like thee: High rank be his, O Lord of Bays.</p><p>Foe of the man who adds no milk, he heeds not any chanted hymn Or holy psalm tha. May he sung.</p><p>Give us not, Indra, as a prey unto the scornful or the proud: Help, Mighty One, with power and might.</p><p>This, even this, O Indra, we implore. as thy devoted friends, the Ka·πávas praise thee with their hymns.</p><p>Naught else, O Thunderer, have I praised in the skilled singer's eulogy: On thy land only have I thought.</p><p>The Devas seek him who presses out the Soma; they desire not sleep They punish sloth unweariedly.</p><p>Come hither swift with gifts of wealth - be not thou angry with us-like a great man with a youthful bride.</p><p>Let him not, wrathful with us, spend the evening far from us to-day, like some unpleasant son-in-law.</p><p>For well we know this Hero's love, most liberal of the boons he gives, His plans whom the three worlds display.</p><p>Pour forth the gift which Ka·πávas bring, for none more glorious do we know Than the Strong Lord with countless aids.</p><p>O presser, offer Soma first to Indra. Hero, Indra, him. The Friend of man, that h. May drink;</p><p>Who, in untroubled ways, is best provider, for his worshippers. Of strength in horses and in kine.</p><p>Pressers, for him blend Soma juice, each draught most excellent, for him. The Brave, the Hero, for his joy.</p><p>The V·πõtra-slayer drinks the juice. May he who gives a hundred aids Approach, nor stay afar from us.</p><p>May the strong Bay Steeds, yoked by prayer, bring hither unto us our Friend, Lover of Song, renowned by songs.</p><p>Sweet are the Soma juices, come! Blent are the Soma juices, come! ·πö·π£i-like, mighty, fair of cheek, come hither quickly to the feast.</p><p>And lauds which strengthen thee for great bounty and valour, and exalt Indra who doeth glorious deeds,</p><p>And songs to thee who lovest song, and all those hymns addressed to thee- These evermore confirm thy might.</p><p>Thus he, sole doer of great deeds whose hand holds thunder, gives us strength. He who hath never been subdued.</p><p>V·πõtra he subdues with his right hand, even Indra, great with mighty power, and much-invoked in many a place.</p><p>He upon whom all men depend, all regions, all achievements, he Takes pleasure in our wealthy chiefs.</p><p>All this hath he accomplished, yea, Indra, most gloriously renowned, who gives our wealthy princes strength.</p><p>Who drives his chariot seeking spoil, from afar, to him he loves: For swift is he to bring men wealth.</p><p>The Sage who, winning spoil with steeds, subdues V·πõtra. Hero with the men, His servant's faithful assister.</p><p>O Priyamedhas, worship with collected mind this Indra whom The Soma hath full well inspired.</p><p>Ye Ka·πávas, sing the Mighty One, Lord of the Brave, who loves renown, All-present, glorified by song.</p><p>Strong Friend, who, with no trace of feet, restores the cattle to the men, who rest their wish and hope on him.</p><p>Shaped as a Ram, Stone-hurler I once thou camest hither to the son Of Ka·πáva, wise MedhyƒÅtithi.</p><p>Vibhindu, thou hast helped this man, giving him thousands four times ten, and afterward eight thousand more.</p><p>And these twain pouring streams of milk, creative, daughters of delight, for wedlock sake I glorify.</p>
