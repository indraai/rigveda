<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>THAT Indra is our youthful Friend, who with his trusty guidance led Turva≈õa, Yadu from afar.</p><p>Even to the dull and uninspired Indra, gives vital power, and wins Even with slow steed the offered prize.</p><p>Great are his ways of guiding us, and·πÖanilbld are Ins eulogies: His kind protections never fail.</p><p>Friends, sing your psalm and offer praise to him to whom the prayer is brought: For our great Providence is he.</p><p>Thou, Slaughterer of V·πõtra, art Guardian and Friend of one and two, Yea, of a man like one of us.</p><p>Beyond men's hate thou leadest us, and givest cause to sing thy praise: Good hero art thou called by men.</p><p>I call with hymns, as ‚Äôtwere a cow to milk, the Friend who merits praise, the Brahman who accepts the prayer.</p><p>Him in whose hands they say are stored all treasures from the days of old, the Hero, conquering in the fight.</p><p>Lord of Strength, Caster of the Stone, destroy the firm forts built by men, and foil their arts, unbending Deva!</p><p>Thee, thee as such, O Lord of Power, O Indra, Soma-drinker, true, We, fain for glory, have invoked.</p><p>Such as thou wast of old, and art now to be called on when the prize lies ready, listen to our call.</p><p>With hymns and coursers we will gain, Indra, through thee, both steeds and spoil Most glorious, and the proffered prize.</p><p>Thou, Indra, Lover of the Song, whom men must stir to help, hast been Great in the contest for the prize.</p><p>Slayer of foes, whatever aid of thine imparts the swiftest course, with that impel our car to speed.</p><p>As skilfullest of those who drive the chariot, with our art and aim win the proffered prize.</p><p>Praise him who, Matchless and Alone, was born the Lord of living men, most active, with heroic soul.</p><p>Thou who hast been the singers' Friend, a friend auspicious with thine aid, as such, O Indra, favour us.</p><p>Grasp in thine arms the thunderbolt, O Thunder-armed, to subdue the fiends: Mayst thou subdue the foemen's host.</p><p>I call the ancient Friend, allied with wealth, who speeds the lowly man, him to whom chiefly prayer is brought.</p><p>For he alone is Lord of all the treasures of the Earth: he speeds Hither, chief Lover of the Song.</p><p>So with thy yoked teams satisfy our wish with power and wealth in steeds And cattle, boldly, Lord of kine!</p><p>Sing this, what time the ' juice is pressed, to him your Hero, Much-invoked, to please him as a mighty Steer.</p><p>He, Excellent, withholdeth not his gift of power and wealth in kine, when he hath listened to our songs.</p><p>May he with might unclose for us the cow's stall, whosesoe‚Äôer it be, to which the Dasyu-slayer goes.</p><p>O Indra ≈öatakratu, these our songs have called aloud to thee, like mother cows to meet their calves.</p><p>Hard is thy love to win: thou art a Steer to him who longs for steers: Be to one craving steeds a Steed.</p><p>Delight thee with the juice we pour for thine own great munificence: Yield not thy singer to reproach.</p><p>These songs with every draught we pour come, Lover of the Song, to thee, as milch-kine hasten to their young</p><p>To thee most oft invoked, amid the many singers' rivalry Who beg with all their might for wealth.</p><p>Nearest and most attractiv. May our laud, O Indra come to thee.</p><p>Urge thou us on to ample wealth.</p><p>Brbu hath set himself above the Pa·πáis, o‚Äôer their highest head, like the wide bush on Gan!gƒÅ's bank.</p><p>He whose good bounty, thousandfold, swift as the rushing of the wind, Suddenly offers as a gift.</p><p>So all our singers ever praise the pious Brbu's noble deed, Chief, best to give his thousands, best to give a thousand liberal gifts.</p>
