May our laud, O Indra come to thee.</p><p>Urge thou us on to ample wealth.</p><p>Brbu hath set himself above the Pa&#7751;is, o&#146;er their highest head, like the wide bush on Gan!g&#257;'s bank.</p><p>He whose good bounty, thousandfold, swift as the rushing of the wind, Suddenly offers as a gift.</p><p>So all our singers ever praise the pious Brbu's noble deed, Chief, best to give his thousands, best to give a thousand liberal gifts.</p>
