<p>THIS, even this was my resolve, to win a cow, to win a steed: Have I not drunk of Soma juice?</p><p>Like violent gusts of wind the draughts that I have drunk have lifted me Have I not drunk of Soma juice?</p><p>The draughts I drank have borne me up, as fleet-foot horses draw a car: Have I not drunk of Soma juice?</p><p>The hymn hath reached me, like a cow who lows to meet her darling calf: Have I not drunk of Soma juice?</p><p>As a wright bends a chariot-seat so round my heart I bend the hymn: Have I not drunk of Soma juice?</p><p>Not as a mote within the eye count the Five Tribes of men with me: Have I not drunk of Soma juice?</p><p>The heavens and Earth themselves have not grown equal to one half of me Have I not drunk of Soma juice?</p><p>I in my grandeur have surpassed the heavens and all this spacious Earth Have I not drunk of Soma juice?</p><p>Aha! this spacious Earth will I deposit either here or there Have I not drunk of Soma juice?</p><p>In one short moment will I smite the Earth in fury here or there: Have I not drunk of Soma juice?</p><p>One of my flanks is in the sky; I let the other trail below: Have I not drunk of Soma juice?</p><p>1, greatest of the Mighty Ones, am lifted to the Firmament: Have I not drunk of Soma juice?</p><p>I seek the worshipper's abode; oblation-bearer to the Devas: Have I not drunk of Soma juice?</p>
