<p>THE Bull hath yielded for the Bull the milk of Heaven: the Son of Aditi can never be deceived.</p><p>According to his wisdom Varu&#7751;a knoweth all. May he, the Holy, hallow times for offering.</p><p>Gandharvi spake. May she, the Lady of the flood, amid the river's roaring leave my heart untouched. May Aditi accomplish all that we desire, an. May our eldest Brother tell us this as Chief.</p><p>Yea, even this blessed Morning, rich in store of food, splendid, with heavenly lustre, hath shone out for man, Since they, as was the wish of yearning Devas, brought forth that yearning Agni for the assembly as the Monk.</p><p>And the fleet Falcon brought for offering from afar this flowing Drop most excellent and keen of sight, then when the &#256;ryan tribes chose as Invoking Monk Agni the Wonder-Worker, and the hymn rose up.</p><p>Still art thou kind to him who feeds thee as with grass, and, skilled in offering, offers thee holy gifts. When thou, having received the sage's strengthening food with lauds, after long toil, cornest with many more.</p><p>Urge thou thy Parents, as a lover ' to delight: the Lovely One desires and craves it from his heart. The priest calls out, the offeringr shows his skill, the Devas tries his strength, and with the hymn is stirred.</p><p>Far-famed is he, the mortal man, O Agni, thou Son of Strength, who hath obtained thy favour. He, gathering power, borne onward by his horses, makes his days lovely in his might and splendour.</p><p>When, Holy Agni, the divine assembly, the sacred synod mid the Devas, is gathered, and when thou, Godlike One, dealest forth treasures, vouchsafe us, too, our portion of the riches.</p><p>Hear us, O Agni, in your common dwelling: harness thy rapid car of Am&#7771;ta. Bring Heaven and Earth, the Deities' Parents, hither: stay with us here, nor from the Devas be distant.</p>
