<p>THIS is that Agni whence the longing Indra took the pressed Soma deep within his body.</p><p>Winner of spoils in thousands, like a courser, with praise art thou exalted, J&#257;tavedas.</p><p>That light of thine in Heaven and Earth, O Agni, in plants, O Holy One, and in the waters, Wherewith thou hast spread wide the air's mid-region-bright is that splendour, wavy, man-beholding.</p><p>O Agni, to the sea of Heaven thou goest: thou hast called hither Devas beheld in spirit. The waters, too, come hither, those up yonder in the Sun's realm of light, and those beneath it.</p><p>Let fires that dwell in mist, combined with those that have their home in floods, Guileless accept our offering, great offerings free from all disease.</p><p>Agni, as holy food to thine invoker give wealth in cattle, lasting, rich in marvels. To us be born a son and spreading offspring. Agni, be this thy gracious will to us-ward.</p>
