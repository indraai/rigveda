<h1>HYMN CXLII. Agni.</h1>
<p>WITH thee, O Agni, was this singer of the laud: he hath no other kinship, O thou Son of Strength.</p>

<p>WITH thee, O Agni, was this singer of the laud: he hath no other kinship, O thou Son of Strength.</p><p>Thou givest blessed shelter with a triple guard. Keep the destructive lightning far away from us.</p><p>Thy birth who seekest food is in the falling flood, Agni: as Comrade thou winnest all living things. Our coursers and our songs shall be victorious: they of themselves advance like one who guards the herd.</p><p>And thou, O Agni, thou of Godlike nature, sparest the stones, while caring up the brushwood. Then are thy tracks like deserts in the corn-lands. Let us not stir to wrath thy mighty arrow.</p><p>O'er hills through vales devouring as thou goest, thou partest like an army fain for booty As when a barber shaves a beard, thou shavest Earth when the wind blows on thy flame and fans it.</p><p>Apparent are his lines as he approaches the course is single, but the cars are many, when, Agni, thou, making thine arms resplendent, advancest o&#146;er the land spread out beneath thee.</p><p>Now let thy strength, thy burning flames fly upward, thine energies, O Agni, as thou toilest. Gape widely, bend thee, waxing in thy vigour: let all the Devas sit this day beside thee.</p><p>This is the waters' reservoir, the great abode of gathered streams. Take thou another path than this, and as thou listest walk thereon.</p><p>On thy way hitherward and hence let flowery Durva grass spring up Let there be lakes with lotus blooms. These are the mansions of the flood.</p>
