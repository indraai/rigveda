<div class="box hymn"><p>SAKRA I praise, to win his aid, far-famed, exceeding bountiful, who gives, as â€™twere in thousands, precious wealth to him who sheds the juice and worships him.</p><p>Arrows with hundred points, unconquerable, are this Indra's n-dghty arms in war.</p><p>He streams on liberal worshippers like a hill with springs, when juices poured have gladdened him.</p><p>What time the flowing Soma-drops have gladdened with their taste the Friend, like water, gracious Lord! were my libations made, like milch-kine to the worshipper.</p><p>To him the peerless, who is calling you to give you aid, forth flow the drops of pleasant meath. The Soloa-drops which call on thee, O gracious Lord, have brought thee to our hymn of praise.</p><p>He rushes hurrying like a steed to Soma that adorns our rite, Which hymns make sweet to thee, lover of pleasant food. The call to Paura thou dost love.</p><p>Praise the strong, grasping Hero, winner of the spoil, ruling supreme oer mighty wealth. Like a full spring, O Thunderer, from thy store hast thou poured on the worshipper evermore.</p><p>Now whether thou be far away, or in the heavens, or on the Earth, O Indra, mighty- thoughted, harnessing thy Bays, come Lofty with the Lofty Ones.</p><p>The Bays who draw thy chariot, Steeds who injure none, surpass the wind's impetuous strength- With whom thou silencest the enemy of man, with whon; thou goest round the sky.</p><p>O gracious Hero. May we learn anew to know thee as thou art: As in decisive fight thou holpest EtaÅ›a, or VaÅ›a 'gainst Dasavraja,</p><p>As, Indra, to Kaá¹‡va at the sacred feast, to Dirghanitha thine home-friend, as to Gosarya thou, Stone-darter, gavest wealth, give me a gold-bright stall of kine.</p>
