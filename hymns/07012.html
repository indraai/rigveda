<p>WE with great reverence have approached The Youngest who hath shone forth well-kindled in his dwelling, with wondrous light between wide Earth and Heaven, well-worshipped, looking forth in all directions.</p><p>Through his great might o&#146;ercoming all misfortunes, praised in the house is Agni J&#257;tavedas.</p><p>May he protect us from disgrace and trouble, both us who laud him and our noble patrons.</p><p>O Agni, thou art Varu&#7751;a and Mitra: Vasisthas with their holy hymns exalt thee. With thee be most abundant gain of treasure. Ye Devas, preserve us evermore with blessings.</p>
