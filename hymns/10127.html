<p>WITH all her eyes the Goddess Night looks forth approaching many a spot: She hath put all her glories on.</p>

<main>
<p>WITH all her eyes the Goddess Night looks forth approaching many a spot: She hath put all her glories on.</p><p>Immortal. she hath filled the wastedess hath filled height and depth: She conquers darkness with her light.</p><p>The Goddess as she comes hath set the Dawn her Sister in her place: And then the darkness vanishes.</p><p>So favour us this night, O thou whose pathways we have visited As birds their nest upon the tree.</p><p>The villagers have sought their homes, and all that walks and all that flies, Even the falcons fain for prey.</p><p>Keep off the she-wolf and the wolf, O Urmya, keep the thief away; Easy be thou for us to pass.</p><p>Clearly hath she come nigh to me who decks the dark with richest hues: O Morning, cancel it like debts.</p><p>These have I brought to thee like kine. O Night, thou Child of Heaven, accept This laud as for a conqueror.</p>
