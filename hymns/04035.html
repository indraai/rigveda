<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>Come hither, O ye Sons of Strength, ye &#7770;bhus; stay not afar, ye Children of Sudhanvan.</p><p>At this libation is your gift of treasure. Let gladdening draughts approach you after Indra's.</p><p>Hither is come the &#7770;bhus' gift of riches; here was the drinking of the well-pressed Soma, Since by dexterity and skill as craftsmen ye made the single chalice to be fourfold </p><p>Ye made fourfold the chalice that wag single: ye spake these words and said, O Friend, assist us; Then, V&#257;jas! gained the path of life eternal, deft-handed &#7770;bhus, to the Devas&#146; assembly.</p><p>Out of what substance was that chalice fashioned which ye made fourfold by your art and wisdom? Now for the gladdening draught press out the liquor, and drink, O &#7770;bhus, of die meath of Soma.</p><p>Ye with your cunning made your Parents youthful; the cup, for Devas to drink, ye formed with cunning; With cunning, &#7770;bhus, rich in treasure, fashioned the two swift Tawny Steeds who carry Indra.</p><p>Whoso pours out for you, when days are closing, the sharp libation for your joy, O V&#257;jas, for him, O mighty &#7770;bhus, ye, rejoicing, have fashioned wealth with plenteous store of heroes.</p><p>Lord of Bay Steeds, at dawn the juice thou drankest: thine, only thine, is the noonday libation. Now drink thou with the wealth-bestowing &#7770;bhus, whom for their skill thou madest friends, O Indra.</p><p>Ye, whom your artist skill hath raised to Godhead have set you down above in Heaven like falcons. So give us riches, Children of Sudhanvan, O Sons of Strength; ye have become immortal.</p><p>The third libation, that bestoweth treasure, which ye have won by skill, ye dexterous-handed,&#151; This drink hath been effused for you, O &#7770;bhus . drink it with high delight, with joy like Indra's.</p>
