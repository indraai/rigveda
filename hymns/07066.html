<div class="box hymn"><p>LET our strong hymn of praise go forth, the laud of Mitra-Indra, with homage to that high-born Pair;</p><p>The Two exceeding wise, the Sons of Daká¹£a, whom the gods ordained For lordship, excellently great.</p><p>Such, Guardians of our homes and us, O Mitra-Indra, fulfil The thoughts of those who sing your praise.</p><p>So when the Sun hath risen to-day. May sinless Mitra, Aryaman, Bhaga, and Indra sendus forth.</p><p>May this our home be guarded well forward, ye Bounteous, on the way, who bear us safely oâ€™er distress.</p><p>And those Self-reigning, Aditi, whose statute is inviolate, the Kings who rule a vast domain.</p><p>Soon as the Sun hath risen, to you, to Mitra-Indra, I sing, and Aryarnan who subdues the foe.</p><p>With wealth of gol. May this my song bring unmolested power and might, and, Brahmans, gain the offering.</p><p>May we be thine, Deva Indra, and with our princes, Mitra, thine.</p><p>Food and Heaven's light will we obtain.</p><p>Many are they who strengthen Law, Sun-eyed, with Agni for their tongue, they who direct the three great gatherings with their thoughts, yea, all things with surpassing might.</p><p>They who have stablished year and month and then the day, night, offering and holy verse, Indra, Mitra, Aryarnan, the Kings, have won dominion which non els. May gain.</p><p>So at the rising of the Sun we think of you with hymns to-day, Even as Indra, Mitra, Aryaman deserve: ye are the charioteers of Law.</p><p>True to Law, born in Law the strengtheners of Law, terrible, haters of the false, in their felicity which gives the best defenc. May we men and our princes dwell.</p><p>Uprises, on the slope of Heaven, that marvel that attracts die sight As swift celestial EtaÅ›a bears it away, prepared forevery eye to see.</p><p>Lord of each single head, of fixt and moving things, equally through the whole expanse, the Seven sister Bays bear SÅ«rya on his car, to bring us wealth and happiness.</p><p>A hundred autumn. May we see that bright Eye, Deva-ordained, arise A hundred autumn. May we live.</p><p>Infallible through your wisdom, come hither, resplendent Indra, and Mitra,H.</p><p>Come as the laws of Heaven ordain, Indra, Mitra, void of guile: Press near and drink the Soma juice.</p><p>Come, Indra, accept. Heroes, our sacrificial gift: Drink Soma, ye who strengthen Law.</p>
