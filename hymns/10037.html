<div class="box hymn"><p>Do homage unto Indra's and Mitra's Eye: offer this solemn worship to the Mighty Deva, who seeth far away, the Ensign, born of Devas. Sing praises unto SÅ«rya, to the Son of Devas.</p><p>May this my truthful speech guard me on every side wherever Heaven and Earth and days are spread abroad.</p><p>All else that is in motion finds a place of rest: the waters ever flow and ever mounts the Sun.</p><p>No godless man from time remotest draws thee down when thou art driving forth with winged dappled Steeds. One lustre waits upon thee moving to the cast, and, SÅ«rya, thou arisest with a different light.</p><p>O SÅ«rya, with the light whereby thou scatterest gloom, and with thy ray impellest every moving thing, Keep far from us all feeble, worthless offering, and drive away disease and every evil dream.</p><p>Sent forth thou guardest well the Universe's law, and in thy wonted way arisest free from wrath. When SÅ«rya, we address our meditations to thee to-day. May the Devas favour this our purpose and desire.</p><p>This invocation, these our word. May Heaven and Earth, and Indra and the Waters and the Devas hear. Neâ€™e. May we suffer want in presence of the Sun, and, living happy lives. May we attain old age.</p><p>Cheerful in spirit, evermore, and keen of sight, with store of children, free from sickness and from sin, Long-living. May we look, O SÅ«rya, upon thee uprising day by day, thou great as Mitra is!</p><p>SÅ«rya. May we live long and look upon thee still, thee, O Far-seeing One, bringing the glorious light, the radiant Deva, the spring of joy to every eye, as thou art mounting up oâ€™er the high shining flood.</p><p>Thou by whose lustre all the world of life comes forth, and by thy beams again returns unto its rest, O SÅ«rya with the golden hair, ascend for us day after day, still bringing purer innocence.</p><p>Bless us with shine, bless us with perfect daylight, bless us with cold, with fervent heat and lustre. Bestow on us, O SÅ«rya, varied riches, to bless us in our home and when we travel.</p><p>Devas, to our living creatures of both kinds vouchsafe protection, both to bipeds and to quadrupeds, that the, may drink and eat invigorating food. So grant us health and strength and perfect innocence.</p><p>If by some grievous sin we have provoked the Devas, O Deities, with the tongue or thoughtlessness of heart, that guilt, O Devas, lay upon the Evil One, on him who ever leads us into deep distress.</p>
