<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>WE compass thee like waters, we whose grass is trimmed and Soma pressed.</p><p>Here where the filter pours its stream, thy worshippers round thee, O V&#7771;tra-slayer, sit.</p><p>Men, Vasu! by the Soma, with lauds call thee to the foremost place: When comest thou athirst unto the juice as home, O Indra, like a bellowing bull?</p><p>Boldly, Bold Hero, bring us spoil in thousands for the Ka&#7751;vas' sake. O active Indra, with eager prayer we crave the yellow-hued with store ol kine.</p><p>Medhy&#257;tithi, to Indra sing, drink of the juice to make thee glad. Close-knit to his Bay Steeds, bolt-armed, beside the juice is he: his chariot is of gold.</p><p>He Who is praised as strong of hand both right and left, most wise and hold: Indra who, rich in hundreds, gathers thousands up, honoured as breaker-down of forts.</p><p>The bold of heart whom none provokes, who stands in bearded confidence; Much-lauded, very glorious, overthrowing foes, strong Helper, like a bull with might.</p><p>Who knows what vital ower he wins, drinking beside the flowing juice? This is the fair-checked Deva who, joying in the draught, breaks down the castles in his strength.</p><p>As a wild elephant rushes on this way and that way, mad with heat,' Non. May compel thee, yet come hither to the draught: thou movest mighty in thy power.</p><p>When he, the Mighty, ne&#146;er o&#146;erthrown, steadfast, made ready for the fight, when Indra Indra lists to his praiser's call, he will not stand aloof, but come.</p><p>Yea, verily, thou art a Bull, with a bull's rush. whom non. May stay: Thou Mighty One, art celebrated as a Bull, famed as a Bull both near and far.</p><p>Thy reins are very bulls in strength, bulls' strength is in thy golden whip. Thy car, O Indra, thy Bays are strong as bulls: thou, &#346;atakratu, art a Bull.</p><p>Let the strong presser press for thee. Bring hither, thou straight-rushing Bull. The mighty makes the mighty run in flowing streams for thee whom thy Bay Horses bear.</p><p>Come, thou most potent Indra, come to drink the savoury Soma juice. Indra, very wise, will quickly come to hear the songs, the prayer, the hymns of praise.</p><p>When thou hast mounted on thy car let thy yoked Bay Steeds carry thee, Past other men's libations, Lord of Hundred Powers, thee, V&#7771;tra-slayer, thee our Friend.</p><p>O thou Most Lofty One, accept our laud as nearest to thine heart. May our libations be most sweet to make thee glad, O Soma-drinker, Heavenly Lord.</p><p>Neither in thy decree nor mine, but in another's he delights,&#151; The man who brought us unto this.</p><p>Indra himself hath said, the mind of woman brooks not discipline, Her intellect hath little weight.</p><p>His pair of horses, rushing on in their wild transport, draw his car: High-lifted is the stallion's yoke.</p><p>Cast down thine eyes and look not up. More closely set thy feet. Let none See what thy garment veils, for thou, a Brahman, hast become a dame.</p>
