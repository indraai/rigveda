<div class="box hymn"><p>SEE, Vena, born in light, hath driven hither, on chariot of the air, the Calves of Pá¹›Å›ni.</p><p>Singers with hymns caress him as an infant there where the waters and the sunlight mingle.</p><p>Vena draws up his wave from out the ocean. mist-born, the fair one's back is made apparent, Brightly he shone aloft on Order's summit: the hosts sang glory to their common birthplace.</p><p>Full many, lowing to their joint-possession, dwelling together stood the Darling's Mothers. Ascending to the lofty height of Order, the bands of singers 'sip the sweets of Amá¹›ta.</p><p>Knowing his form, the sages yearned to meet him: they have come nigh to hear the wild Bull's bellow. Performing offering they reached the river: for the Gandharva found the immortal waters.</p><p>The Apsaras, the Lady, sweetly smiling, supports her Lover in sublimest Heaven. In his Friend's dwelling as a friend he wanders: he, Vena, rests him on his golden pinion.</p><p>They gaze on thee with longing in their spirit, as on a strong-winged bird that mounteth sky-ward; On thee with wings of gold, Indra's envoy, the Bird that hasteneth to the home of Yama.</p><p>Erect, to Heaven hath the Gandharva mounted, pointing at us his many-coloured weapons; Clad in sweet raiment beautiful to look on, for he, as light, produceth forms that please us.</p><p>When as a spark he cometh near the ocean, still looking with a vulture's eye to Heaven, His lustre, joying in its own bright splendour, maketh dear glories in the lowest region.</p>
