<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>WAKE with one mind, my friends, and kindle Agni, ye who are many and who dwell together.</p><p>Agni and Dadhikr&#257;s and Dawn the Goddess, you, Devas with Indra, I call down to help us.</p><p>Make pleasant hymns, spin out your songs and praises: build ye a ship equipped with oars for transport. Prepare the implements, make all things ready, and let the offering, my friends, go forward.</p><p>Lay on the yokes, and fasten well the traces: formed is the furrow, sow the seed within it. Through son. May we find bearing fraught with plenty: near to the ripened grain approach the sickle.</p><p>Wise, through desire of bliss from Devas, the skilful bind the traces fast, and lay the yokes on either side.</p><p>Arrange the buckets in their place securely fasten on the straps. We will pour forth the well that hath a copious stream, fair-flowing well that never fails.</p><p>I pour the water from the well with pails prepared and goodly straps, Unfailing, full, with plenteous stream.</p><p>Refresh the horses, win the prize before you: equip a chariot fraught with happy fortune. Pour forth the well with stone wheel, wooden buckets, the drink of heroes, with the trough for armour.</p><p>Prepare the cow-stall, for there drink your heroes: stitch ye the coats of armour, wide and many. Make iron forts, secure from all assailants let not your pitcher leak: stay it securely.</p><p>Hither, for help, I turn the holy heavenly mind of you the Holy Devas, that longs for offering. May it pour milk for us, even as a stately cow who, having sought the pasture, yields a thousand streams.</p><p>Pour golden juice within the wooden vessel: with stone-made axes fashion ye and form it. Embrace and compass it with tenfold girdle, and to both chariot-poles attach the car-horse.</p><p>Between both poles the car-horse goes pressed closely, as in his dwelling moves the doubly-wedded. Lay in the wood the Soviran of the Forest, and sink the well although ye do not dig it.</p><p>Indra is he, O men, who gives us happiness: sport, urge the giver of delight to win us strength Bring quickly down, O monks, hither to give us aid, , Indra Son of Nistigri.</p>
