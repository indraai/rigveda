<h2>HYMN XXXI. Indra.</h2>

<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>WISE, teaching, following the thought of Order, the sonless gained a grandson from his daughter.</p><p>Fain, as a sire, to see his child prolific, he sped to meet her with an eager spirit.</p><p>The Son left not his portion to the brother, he made a home to hold him who should gain, it. What time his Parents gave the Monk his being, of the good pair one acted, one promoted.</p><p>Agni was born trembling with tongue that flickered, so that the Red's great children should be honoured. Great is their germ, that born of them is mighty, great the Bays' Lord's approach through offers.</p><p>Conquering bands upon the Warrior waited: they recognized great light from out the darkness. The conscious Dawns went forth to meet his coming, and the sole Master of the kine was Indra.</p><p>The sages freed them from their firmbuilt prison: the seven monks drove them forward with their spirit. All holy Order's pathway they discovered he, full of knowledge, shared these deeds through worship.</p><p>When Saram&#257; had found the mountain's fissure, that vast and ancient place she plundered thoroughly. In the floods' van she led them forth, light-footed: she who well knew came first unto their lowing.</p><p>Longing for friendship came the noblest singer: the hill poured forth its treasure for the pious. The Hero with young followers fought and conquered, and straightway A&#7749;giras was singing praises,</p><p>Peer of each noble thing, yea, all excelling, all creatures doth he know, he slayeth &#346;u&#7779;&#7751;a. Our leader, fain for war, singing from Heaven, as Friend he saved his lovers from dishonour.</p><p>They sate them down with spirit fain for booty, making with hymns a way to life eternal. And this is still their place of frequent session, whereby they sought to gain the months through Order.</p><p>Drawing the milk of ancient seed prolific, they joyed as they beheld their own possession. Their shout of triumph heated Earth and Heaven. When the kine showed, they bade the heroes rouse them.</p><p>Indra drove forth the kine, that V&#7771;tra-slayer, while hymns of praise rose up and gifts were offered. For him the Cow, noble and far-extending, poured pleasant juices, bringing oil and sweetness.</p><p>They made a mansion for their Father, deftly provided him a great and glorious dwelling; With firm support parted and stayed the Parents, and, sitting, fixed him there erected, mighty.</p><p>What time the ample chalice had impelled him, swift waxing, vast, to pierce the Earth and Heaven,&#151; Him in whom blameless songs are all united: all powers invincible belong to Indra.</p><p>I crave thy powers, I crave thy mighty friendship: full many a team goes to the V&#7771;tra-slayer. Great is the laud, we seek the Princes' favour. Be thou, O Indra, our guard and keeper.</p><p>He, having found great, splendid, rich dominion, sent life and motion to his friends and lovers. Indra who shone together with the Heroes begot the song, the fire, and Sun and Morning.</p><p>Vast, the House-Friend, he set the waters flowing, all-lucid, widely spread, that move together. By the wise cleansings of the meath made holy, through days, and nights they speed the swift streams onward.</p><p>To thee proceed the dark, the treasure-holders, both of them sanctified by S&#363;rya's bounty. The while thy ovely storming Friends, O Indra, fail to attain the measure of thy greatness.</p><p>Be Lord of joyous songs, O V&#7771;tra-slayer, Bull dear to all, who gives the power of living. Come unto us with thine auspicious friendship, hastening, Mighty One, with mighty succours.</p><p>Like A&#7749;giras I honour him with worship, and renovate old song for him the Ancient. Chase thou the many godless evil creatures, and give us, Indra. Heaven's light to help m.</p><p>Far forth are spread the purifying waters convey thou us across them unto safety. Save us, our Charioteer, from harm, O Indra, soon, very soon, make us win spoil of cattle.</p><p>His kine their Lord hath shown, e&#146;en V&#7771;tra's slayer, through the black hosts he passed with red attendants. Teaching us pleasant things by holy Order, to, us hath he thrown open all his portals.</p><p>Call we on Indra, auspicious Indra, best Hero in this fight where spoil is gathered. The Strong who listens, who gives aid in battles, who subdues the V&#7771;tras, wins and gathers riches.</p>
