<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>WE call thee, Lord and Leader of the heavenly hosts, the wise among the wise, the famousest of all, the King supreme of prayers, O Brahma&#7751;aspati: hear us with help; sit down in place of offering.</p><p>B&#7771;haspati, God immortal! verily the Devas have gained from thee, the wise, a share in holy rites.</p><p>As with great light the Sun brings forth the rays of morn, so thou alone art Father of all sacred prayer.</p><p>When thou hast chased away revilers and the gloom, thou mountest the refulgent car of offering; The awful car, that quells the foe, subdues demons, cleaves the stall of kine, and finds the light.</p><p>Thou leadest with good guidance and preservest men; distress o&#146;ertakes not him who offers gifts to thee. Him who hates prayer thou punishest, quelling his wrath: herein is thy great mightiness.</p><p>No sorrow, no distress from any side, no foes, no creatures double-tongued have overcome the man,&#151; Thou drivest all seductive fiends away from him whom, careful guard, thou keepest Brahma&#7751;aspati.</p><p>Thou art our keeper, wise, preparer of our paths: we, for thy service, sing to thee with hymns of praise. B&#7771;haspati, whoever lays a snare for us, hi. May his evil fate, precipitate, destroy.</p><p>Him, too, who threatens us without offence of ours, the evilminded, arrogant, rapacious man,&#151; Him turn thou from our path away, B&#7771;haspati: give us fair access to this banquet of the Devas.</p><p>Thee as protector of our bodies we invoke, thee, saviour, as the comforter who loveth us. Strike, O B&#7771;haspatis&#146; revilers down, and let not the unrighteous come to highest bliss.</p><p>Through thee, kind prosperer, O Brahma&#7751;aspati. May we obtain the wealth of Men which all desire: And all our enemies, who near or far away prevail against us, crush, and leave them destitute.</p><p>With thee as our own rich and liberal all. May we, gain highest power of life. Let not the guileful wicked man be lord of us:&#151;stil. May we prosper, singing goodly hymns of praise.</p><p>Strong, never yielding, hastening to the battle-cry, consumer of the foe, victorious in the strife, Thou art sin's true avenger, Brahma&#7751;aspati, who tamest e&#146;en the fierce, the wildly passionate.</p><p>Whoso with mind ungodly seeks to do us harm, who, deeming him a man of might mid lords, would subdue,&#151; Let not his deadly blow reach us, B&#7771;haspati. May we humiliate the strong ill-doer's wrath.</p><p>The mover mid the spoil, the winner of all wealth, to be invoked in fight and reverently adored, B&#7771;haspati hath overthrown like cars of war all wicked enemies who fain would injure us.</p><p>Burn up the demons with thy fiercest flaming brand, those who have scorned thee in thy manifested might. Show forth that power that shall deserve the hymn of praise: destroy the evil speakers, O B&#7771;haspati.</p><p>B&#7771;haspati, that which the foe deserves not which shines among the folk effectual, splendid, that, Son of Law I which is with might refulgent-that treasure wonderful bestow thou on us.</p><p>Give us not up to those who, foes in ambuscade, are greedy for the wealth of him who sits at ease, who cherish in their heart abandonment of Devas. B&#7771;haspati, no further rest shall they obtain.</p><p>For Tva&#7779;&#7789;ar, he who knows each sacred song, brought thee to life, preeminent o&#146;er all the things that be. Guilt-scourger, guilt-avenger is B&#7771;haspati, who subdues the spoiler and upholds the mighty Law.</p><p>The mountain, for thy glory, cleft itself apart when, A&#7749;giras! thou openedst the stall of kine. Thou, O B&#7771;haspati, with Indra for ally didst hurl down water-floods which gloom had compassed round.</p><p>O Brahma&#7751;aspati, be thou controller of this our hymn and prosper thou our children. All that the Devas regard with love is blessed. Lou. May we speak, with heroes, in assembly.</p>
