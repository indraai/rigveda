<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>To you pure juice, rich in meath, are offered by priest: through longing for the Pair of Heroes.</p><p>Drive, V&#257;yu, bring thine harnessed horses hither: drink the pressed Soma till it make thee joyful.</p><p>Whoso to thee, the Mighty, brings oblation, pure Soma unto thee, pure-drinking V&#257;yu, that man thou makest famous among mortals: to him strong sons are born in quick succession.</p><p>The Deva whom both these worlds brought forth for riches, whom heavenly Dhi&#7779;a&#7751;&#257; for our wealth appointeth, His team of harnessed horses waits on V&#257;yu, and, foremost, on the radiant Treasure-bearer.</p><p>The spotless Dawns with fair bright days have broken; they found the spacious light when they were shining. Eagerly they disclosed the stall of cattle: floods streamed for them as in the days aforetime.</p><p>These with their truthful spirit, shining brightly, move on provided with their natural insight. Viands attend the car that beareth Heroes, your car, ye Sovran Pair, Indra and V&#257;yu.</p><p>May these who give us heavenly light, these rulers, with gifts of kine and horses, gold and treasures. These princes, through full life, Indra and V&#257;yu! o&#146;ercome in battle with their steeds and heroes.</p><p>Like coursers seeking fame will we Vasisthas, O Indra-V&#257;yu, with our fair laudations. Exerting all our power call you to aid us. Preserve us evermore, ye Devas, with blessings.</p>
