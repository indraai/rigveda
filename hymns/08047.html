<p>GREAT help ye give the worshipper, Varu&#7751;</p>

<p>GREAT help ye give the worshipper, Varu&#7751;a, Mitra, Mighty Ones! No sorrow ever reaches him whom ye, &#256;dityas, keep from harm. Yours are incomparable aids, and good the succour they afford.</p><p>O Devas, &#256;dityas, well ye know the way to keep all woes afar.</p><p>As the birds spread their sheltering wings, spread your protection over us.</p><p>As the birds spread their sheltering wings let your protection cover us. We mean all shelter and defence, ye who have all things for your own.</p><p>To whomsoever they, most Wise, have given a home and means of life, O'er the whole riches of this man they, the &#256;dityas, have control.</p><p>As drivers of the car avoid ill roads, let sorrows pass us by. May we be under Indra's guard, in the &#256;dityas&#146; favouring grace.</p><p>For verily men sink and faint through loss of wealth which ye have given. Much hath he gained from you, O Devas, whom ye, &#256;dityas, have approached.</p><p>On him shall no fierce anger fall, no sore distress shall visit him, to whom, &#256;dityas, ye have lent your shelter that extendeth far.</p><p>Resting in you, O Devas, we are like men who fight in coats of mail. Ye guard us from each great offence, ye guard us from each lighter fault.</p><p>May Aditi defend us. May Aditi guard and shelter us, Mother of wealthy Mitra and of Aryaman and Varu&#7751;a.</p><p>The shelter, Devas, that is secure, auspicious, free from malady, a sure protection, triply strong, even that do ye extend to us.</p><p>Look down on us, &#256;dityas, as a guide exploring from the bank. Lead us to pleasant ways as men lead horses to an easy ford.</p><p>Ill be it for the demons' friend to find us or come near to us. But for the milch-cow be it well, and for the man who strives for fame.</p><p>Each evil deed made manifest, and that which is concealed, O Devas, the whole thereof remove from us to Trita &#256;ptya far away.</p><p>Daughter of Heaven, the dream that bodes evil to us or to our kine, Remove, O Lady of the Light, to Trita &#256;ptya far away.</p><p>Even if, O Child of Heaven, it make a garland or a chain of gold, the whole bad dream, whate&#146;er it be, to Trita &#256;ptya we consign.</p><p>To him whose food and work is this, who comes to take his share therein, to Trita, and to Dvita, Dawn! bear thou the evil dream away.</p><p>As we collect the utmost debt, even the eighth and sixteenth part, So unto &#256;ptya we transfer together all the evil dream.</p><p>Now have we conquered and obtained, and from our trespasses are free. Shine thou away the evil dream, O Dawn, whereof we are afraid. Yours are incomparable aids, and good the succour they afford.</p>
