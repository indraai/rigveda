<h1>HYMN XLVIII. Dawn.</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>DAWN on us with prosperity, O Uṣas, Daughter of the Sky, Dawn with great glory, Goddess, Lady of the Light, dawn thou with riches, Bounteous One.</p><p>They, bringing steeds and kine, boon-givers of all wealth, have oft sped forth to lighten us.</p><p>O Uṣas, waken up for me the sounds of joy: send us the riches of the great.</p><p>Uṣas hath dawned, and now shall dawndess, driver forth of cars Which, as she cometh nigh, have fixed their thought on her, like glory-seekers on the flood.</p><p>Here Kaṇva, chief of Kaṇva's race, sings forth aloud the glories of the heroes’ names,— The. princes who, O Uṣas, as thou comest near, direct their thoughts to liberal gifts.</p><p>Like a good matron Uṣas comes carefully tending everything: Rousing all life she stirs all creatures that have feet, and makes the birds of air fly up.</p><p>She sends the busy forth, each man to his pursuit: delay she knows not as she springs. O rich in opulence, after thy dawning birds that have flown forth no longer rest.</p><p>This Dawn hath yoked her steeds afar, beyond the rising of the Sun: Borne on a hundred chariots she, auspicious Dawn, advances on her way to Men.</p><p>To meet her glance all living creatures bend them down: Excellent One, she makes the light. Uṣas, the Daughter of the Sky, the opulent, shines foes and enmities away.</p><p>Shine on us with thy radiant light, O Uṣas, Daughter of the Sky, Bringing to us great store of high felicity, and beaming on our solemn rites.</p><p>For in thee is each living creature's breath and life, when, Excellent! thou dawnest forth. Borne on thy lofty car, O Lady of the Light, hear, thou of wondrous wealth, our call.</p><p>O Uṣas, win thyself the strength which among men is wonderful. Bring thou thereby the pious unto holy rites, those who as monks sing praise to thee.</p><p>Bring from the Firmament, O Uṣas, all the Devas, that they may drink our Soma juice, and, being what thou art, vouchsafe us kine and steeds, strength meet for praise and hero might.</p><p>May Uṣas whose auspicious rays are seen resplendent round about, Grant us great riches, fair in form, of all good things, wealth which light labour may attain.</p><p>Mighty One, whom the Ṛṣis of old time invoked for their protection and their help, O Uṣas, graciously answer our songs of praise with bounty and with brilliant light.</p><p>Uṣas, as thou with light to day hast opened the twin doors of Heaven, So grant thou us a dwelling wide and free from foes. O Goddess, give us food with kine.</p><p>Bring us to wealth abundant, sent in every shape, to plentiful refreshing food, to all-subduing splendour, Uṣas, Mighty One, to strength, thou rich in spoil and wealth.</p>
