<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>THE men from fire-sticks, with their hands' swift movement, have, in deep thought, engendered glorious Agni, Far-seen, with pointed flame, Lord of the homestead.</p><p>The Devas set that Agni in the dwelling, fair to behold, for help from every quarter: Who, in the home forever, must be honoured.</p><p>Shine thou before us, Agni, well-enkindled, with flame, most Youthful Deva, that never fadeth.</p><p>To thee come all our sacrificial offerings.</p><p>Among all fires these fires have shone most brightly, splendid with light, begirt by noble heroes, Where men of lofty birth sit down together.</p><p>Victorious Agni, grant us wealth with wisdom, wealth with brave sons, famous and independent, Which not a foe who deals in magic conquers.</p><p>To whom, the Strong, at morn and eve comes, maid-like, the ladle dropping oil, with its oblation. Wealth-seeking comes to him his own devotion.</p><p>Burn up all malice with those flames, O Agni, and drive away in silence pain and sickness.</p><p>With him who lighteth up thy splendour, Agni, excellent, pure, refulgent, Purifier, be present, and with us through these our praises.</p><p>Agni, the patriarchal men, the mortals who have in many places spread thy lustre,&#151; Be gracious to us here for their sake also.</p><p>Let these men, heroes in the fight with foemen, prevail against all godless arts of 4magic,&#151; These who ipprove the noble song I sing thee.</p><p>Let us not sit in want of men, O Agni, without descendants, heroleu, about thee: But, O House-Friend, in houses full of children.</p><p>By offering there make our dwelling rich in seed and offspring, Increasing still with lineal successors.</p><p>Guard us, O Agni, guard us from malice of the churlish sinner: Allied with the, may I subdue assailants.</p><p>May this same fire of mine surpass all others, this fire where offspring, vigorous and firm-handed, Wins, on a thousand paths, what ne&#146;er shall perish.</p><p>This is that Agni, saviour from the foeman, who guards the kindler of the flame from sorrow: Heroes of noble lineage serve and tend him.</p><p>This is that Agni, served in many places, whom the rich lord who brings oblation kindles, and round him goes the Monk at offers.</p><p>Agni. May we with riches in possession bring thee continual ofierings in abundance, Using both means to draw thee to our worship.</p><p>Agni, bear thou, Eternal, these most welcome oblations to the Deities' assembly: Let them enjoy our very fragrant presents.</p><p>Give us not up, Agni, to want of heroes, to wretched clothes, to need, to destitution. Yield us not, Holy One, to fiend or hunger; injure us not at home or in the forest.</p><p>Give strength and power to these my meditations, O Agni, pour blessings on us. Grant that both we and the, may share thy bounty. Ye Devas, protect us evermore with blessings.</p><p>Thou Agni, swift to hear, art fair of aspect: beam forth, O Son of Strength, in full effulgence. Let me not want, with thee, a son forever: let not a manly hero ever fail us.</p><p>O Agni, beside these flaming fires which Devas have kindled, O Son of Strength, o&#146;ertake us.</p><p>O Agni, fair of face, the wealthy mortal who to the Immortal offers his oblation. Hath him who wins him treasure by his Godhead, to whom the prince, in need, goes supplicating.</p><p>Knowing our chief felicity, O Agni, bring hither ample riches to our nobles, Wherewith we may enjoy ourselves, O Victor, with undiminished life and hero children.</p><p>Give strength and power to these my meditations, O Agni, pour blessings on bur chiefs and nobles. Grant that both we and the, may share thy bounty. Ye Devas, protect us evermore with blessings.</p>
