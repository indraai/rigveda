<div class="box hymn"><p>WHERE hath the hymn with reverence, like an envoy, found both fair Devas to-day, invoked of many- Hymn that hath brought the two Nﾄ《atyas hither? To this man's thought be ye, both Devas, most friendly.</p><p>Come readily to this mine invocation, lauded with songs, that y. May drink the juices.</p><p>Compass this house to keep it from the foeman, that non. May force it, either near or distant.</p><p>Juice in wide room hath been prepared to feast you: for you the grass is strewn, most soft to tread on. With lifted hands your servant hath adored you. Yearningfor you the press-stones shed the liquid.</p><p>Agni uplifts him at your offerings: forth goes the oblation dropping oil and glowing. Up stands the grateful-minded priest, elected, appointed to invoke the two Nﾄ《atyas.</p><p>Lords of great wealth! for glory, Sﾅｫrya's Daughter mounted your car that brings a hundred assists. Famed for your magic arts were ye, magicians! amid the race of Devas, ye dancing Heroes!</p><p>Ye Twain, with these your glories fair to look on, brought, to win victory, rich gifts for Sﾅｫrya. After you flew your birds, marvels of beauty: dear to our hearts! the song, well lauded, reached you.</p><p>May your winged coursers, best to draw. Nﾄ《atyas! convey you to the object of your wishes. Swift as the thought, your car hath been sent onward to food of many a sort and dainty offerings.</p><p>Lords of great wealth, manifold is your bounty: ye filled our cow with food that never faileth. Lovers of sweetness! yours are praise and singers, and poured libations which have sought your favour.</p><p>Mine were two mares of Puraya, brown, swift-footed; a hundred with Sumidha, food with Peruk Sanda gave ten gold-decked and well-trained horses, tame and obedient and of lofty stature.</p><p>Nﾄ《atyas! Purupanthas offered hundreds, thousands of steeds to him who sang your praises, Gave. Heroes! to the singer Bharadvﾄ）a. Ye-Wonder-Workers, let the fiends be slaughtered.</p><p>May I with princes share your bliss in freedom.</p>
