<h2>HYMN XVII. Indra.</h2>

<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>GREAT art thou, Indra; yea, the Earth, with gladness, and Heaven confess to thee thine high dominion.</p><p>Thou in thy vigour having slaughtered V&#7771;tra didst free the floods arrested by the Dragon.</p><p>Heaven trembled at the birth of thine effulgence; Earth trembled at the fear of thy displeasure. The stedfast mountains shook in agitation . the waters flowed, and desert spots were flooded.</p><p>Hurling his bolt with might he cleft the mountain, while, putting forth his strength, he showed his vigour. He slaughtered V&#7771;tra with his bolt, exulting, and, their lord slain, forth flowed the waters swiftly.</p><p>Thy Father Devas esteemed himself a hero: most noble was the work of Indra's Maker, His who begat the strong bolt's Lord who roareth, immovable like Earth from her foundation.</p><p>He who alone o&#146;erthrows the world of creatures, Indra the peoples' King, invoked of many- Verily all rejoice in him, extolling the boons which Indra the Deva hath sent them.</p><p>All Soma juices are his own forever, most gladdening draughts are ever his, the Mighty, Thou ever wast the Treasure-Lord of treasures: Indra, thou lettest all folk share thy bounty.</p><p>Moreover, when thou first wast born, O Indra, thou struckest terror into all the people. Thou, Indra, rentest with thy bolt the Dragon who lay against the waterfloods of Heaven.</p><p>The ever-subduing, bold and furious Indra, the bright bolt's Lord, infinite, strong and mighty, who slayeth V&#7771;tra and acquireth booty, giver of blessings, Indra the bounteous:</p><p>Alone renowned as Indra in battles, he frighteneth away assembled armies. He bringeth us the booty that he winnet. May we, well-loved, continue in his friendship.</p><p>Renowned is he when conquering and when subduing: 'fis he who winneth cattle in the combat. When Indra hardeneth his indignation all that is fixed and all that moveth fear him.</p><p>Indra hath won all kine, all gold, all horses,&#151;Indra, he who breaketh forts in pieces; Most manly with these men of his who help him, dealing out wealth and gathering the treasure.</p><p>What is the care of Indra for his Mother, what cares he for the Father who begat him? His care is that which speeds his might in conflicts, like wind borne onward by the clouds that thunder.</p><p>Indra makes the settled man unsettled: he scatters dust that he hath swept together, Breaking in pieces like Heaven armed with lightning: Indra shall enrich the man who lauds h;m.</p><p>He urged the chariot-wheel of S&#363;rya forward: Eta&#347;a, speeding on his way, he rested. Him the black undulating cloud bedeweth, in this mid-air's depth, at the base of darkness,</p><p>As in the night the sacrificing priest.</p><p>Eager for booty, craving strength and horses, we-singers stir Indra, the strong, for friendship, who gives the wives we seek, whose succour fails not, to hasten, like a pitcher to the fountain.</p><p>Be thou our guardian, show thyself our kinsman, watching and blessing those who pour the Soma; As Friend, as Sire, most fatherly of fathers giving the suppliant vital strength and freedom.</p><p>Be helping Friend of those who seek thy friendship . give life, when lauded, Indra, to the singer. For, Indra, we the monks have paid thee worship, exalting thee with these our offerings.</p><p>Alone, when Indra Indra is lauded, he slayeth many ne&#146;er-resisted V&#7771;tras. Him in whose keeping is the well-loved singer never do Devas or mortals stay or hinder.</p><p>E&#146;en so let Indra, the loud-voiced Indra, give us true blessings, foeless, men's upholder. King of all creatures, give us glory amply, exalted glory due to him who lauds thee.</p><p>Now, Indra! lauded, glorified with praises, let power swell high like rivers for the singer. For thee a new hymn, Lord of Bays! is fashioned. May we, car-borne, through song be victors ever.</p>
