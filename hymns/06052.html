May the sky scorch the man who hates devotion.</p><p>Why then, O Soma, do they call thee keeper of prayer? Why then our guardian from reproaches? Why then beholdest thou how men revile us? Cast thy hot dart at him who hates devotion.</p><p>May Mornings as they spring to life, protect me, an. May the Rivers as they swell preserve me. My guardians be the firmly-seated mountains: the Fathers, when I call on Devas, defend me!</p><p>Through all our day. May we be healthy. minded, and look upon the Sun when he arises. Grant this the Treasure-Lord of treasures, coming, observant, oftenest of Devas, with assist!</p><p>Most near, most oft comes Indra with protection, and she SarasvatÄ«, who swells with rivers - Parjanya, bringing health with herbs, and Agni, well lauded swift to listen, like a father.</p><p>Hear this mine invocation; come hither, O Universal Devas, be seated on this holy grass.</p><p>To him who comes to meet you, Devas, with offerings bathed in holy oil- Approach ye, one and all, to him.</p><p>All Sons of Immortality shall listen to the songs we sing, and be exceeding good to us.</p><p>May all the Devas who strengthen Law, with á¹štus, listening to our call, be pleased with theit appropriate draught.</p><p>May Indra, with the Marut host, with Tvaá¹£á¹­ar, Mitra, Aryaman, accept the laud and these our gifts.</p><p>O Agni, Monk, as rules ordain, offer this offering of ours, Remembering the Heavenly Folk.</p><p>Listen, All-Devas, to this mine invocation, Ye who inhabit Heaven, and air's midregions, All ye, O Holy Ones, whose tongue is Agni, seated upon this sacred grass, be joyful.</p><p>May the All-Devas who claim our worship hear my thought. May the two World-halves hear it, and the Watersâ€™ Child. Let me not utter words that y. May disregard. Closely allied with yo. May we rejoice in bliss.</p><p>And those who, Mighty, with the wiles of serpents, were born on Earth, in Heaven, where waters gather- May they vouchsafe us life of full duration. May the Devas kindly give us nights and mornings.</p><p>At this my call, O Agni and Parjanya, help, swift to hear, my thought and our laudation. One generates holy food, the other offspring, so grant us food enough with store of children.</p><p>When holy grass is strewn and fire enkindled, with hymn and lowly homage I invite you. All-Devas, to day in this our great assembly rejoice, ye Holy, in the gifts we offer.</p>
