<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>WITH this my reverent hymn I call Agni for you, the Son of Strength, Dear, wisest envoy, served with noble offering, immortal messenger of all.</p><p>His two red horses, all-supporting, let him yoke: let him, well-worshipped, urge them fast.</p><p>Then hath the offering good prayers and happy end, and heavenly gift of wealth to men.</p><p>The flame of him the Bountiful, the Much-invoked, hath mounted up, and his red-coloured smoke-clouds reach and touch the sky: the men are kindling Agni well.</p><p>Thee, thee Most Glorious One we make our messenger. Bring the Devas hither to the feast. Give us, O Son of Strength, all food that fcedeth man: give that for which we pray to thee.</p><p>Thou, Agni, art the homestead's Lord, our Herald at the offering. Lord of all boons, thou art the Cleanser and a Sage. Pay worship, and enjoy the good.</p><p>Give riches to the offeringr, O Most Wise, for thou art he who granteth wealth. Inspire with zeal each priest at this our solemn rite; all who are skilled in singing praise.</p><p>O Agni who art worshipped well, dear let our princes he to thee, Our wealthy patrons who are governors of men, who part, as gifts, their stalls of kine.</p><p>They in whose home, her hand bearing the sacred oil, I&#7735;&#257; sits down well-satisfied- Guard them, Victorious Deva, from slander and from harm. give us a refuge famed afar.</p><p>Do thou, a Monk with pleasant tongue, most wise, and very near to us, Agni, bring riches hither to our liberal chiefs, and speed the oflering of our gifts.</p><p>They who bestow as bounty plenteous wealth of steeds, moved by desire of great renown- Do thou with saving help preserve them from distress, most Youthful! with a hundred forts.</p><p>The Deva who gives your wealth demands a full libation poured to him. Pour ye it forth, then fill the vessel full again: then doth the Deva pay heed to you.</p><p>Him have the Devas appointed Monk of offering, oblation-bearer, passing wise. Agni gives wealth and valour to the worshipper, to folk who offer up their gifts.</p>
