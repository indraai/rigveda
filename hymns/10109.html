<h1>HYMN CIX. Vi&#347;vedevas.</h1>
<p>THESE first, the boundless Sea, and M&#257;</p>
</section>
<main>
<p>THESE first, the boundless Sea, and M&#257;tari&#347;van, fierce-glowing Fire, the Strong, the Bliss-bestower.</p><p>And heavenly Floods, first-born by holy Order, exclaimed against the outrage on a Brahman.</p><p>King Soma first of all, without reluctance, made restitution of the Brahman's consort. Mitra and Varu&#7751;a were the inviters: Agni as Hota; took her hand and led her.</p><p>The man, her pledge, must by her hand be taken when they have cried, she is a Brahman's consort. She stayed not for a herald to conduct her: thus is the kingdom of a ruler guarded.</p><p>Thus spake of her those Devas of old, Seven &#7770;&#7779;is who sate them down to their austere devotion: Dire is a Brahman's wife led home by others: in the supremest Heaven she plants confusion.</p><p>The Brahmacari goes engaged in duty: he is a member of the Devas&#146; own body. Through him B&#7771;haspati obtained his consort, as the Devas gained the ladle brought by Soma.</p><p>So then the Devas restored her, so men gave the woman back again. The Kings who kept their promises restored the Brahman's wedded wife,</p><p>Having restored the Brahman's wife, and freed them, with Devas&#146; aid, from sin, they shared the fulness of the Earth, and won themselves extended sway.</p>
