<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>WHAT wish of Saram&#257; hath brought her hither? The path leads far away to distant places.</p><p>What charge hast thou for us? Where turns thy journey? How hast thou made thy way o&#146;er Ras&#257;'s waters.</p><p>I come appointed messenger of Indra, seeking your ample stores of wealth, O Pa&#7751;is. This hath preserved me from the fear of crossing: thus have I made my way o&#146;er Ras&#257;'s waters.</p><p>What is that Indra like, what is his aspect whose envoy, Saram&#257;, from afar thou comest? Let him approach, and we will show him friendship: he shall be made the herdsman of our cattle.</p><p>I know him safe from harm: but he can punish who sent me hither from afar as envoy. Him rivers flowing with deep waters bide not. Low will ye be, O Pa&#7751;is, slain by Indra.</p><p>These are the kine which, Saram&#257;, thou seekest, flying, O Blest One, to the ends of Heaven. Who will loose these for thee without a battle? Yea, and sharp-pointed are our warlike weapons.</p><p>Even if your wicked bodies, O ye Pa&#7751;is, were arrow-proof, your words are weak for wounding; And were the path to you as yet unmastered, B&#7771;haspati in neither case will spare you.</p><p>Paved with the rock is this our treasure-chamber; filled full of precious things, of kine, and horses. These Pa&#7751;is who are watchful keepers guard it. In vain hast thou approached this lonely station.</p><p>&#7770;&#7779;is will come inspirited with Soma, A&#7749;girases unwearied, and Navagvas. This stall of cattle will they part among them: then will the Pa&#7751;is wish these words unspoken.</p><p>Even thus, O Saram&#257;, hast thou come hither, forced by celestial might to make the journey. Turn thee not back, for thou shalt be our sister: O Blest One, we will give thee of the cattle.</p><p>Brotherhood, sisterhood, I know not either: the dread A&#7749;girases and Indra know them. They seemed to long for kine when I departed. Hence, into distance, be ye gone, O Pa&#7751;is.</p><p>Hence, far away, ye Pa&#7751;is! Let the cattle lowing come forth as holy Law commandeth, Kine which B&#7771;haspati, and Soma, &#7770;&#7779;is, sages, and pressing-stones have found when hidden.</p>
