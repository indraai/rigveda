<div class="box hymn"><p>WHAT wish of Saramā hath brought her hither? The path leads far away to distant places.</p><p>What charge hast thou for us? Where turns thy journey? How hast thou made thy way o’er Rasā's waters.</p><p>I come appointed messenger of Indra, seeking your ample stores of wealth, O Paṇis. This hath preserved me from the fear of crossing: thus have I made my way o’er Rasā's waters.</p><p>What is that Indra like, what is his aspect whose envoy, Saramā, from afar thou comest? Let him approach, and we will show him friendship: he shall be made the herdsman of our cattle.</p><p>I know him safe from harm: but he can punish who sent me hither from afar as envoy. Him rivers flowing with deep waters bide not. Low will ye be, O Paṇis, slain by Indra.</p><p>These are the kine which, Saramā, thou seekest, flying, O Blest One, to the ends of Heaven. Who will loose these for thee without a battle? Yea, and sharp-pointed are our warlike weapons.</p><p>Even if your wicked bodies, O ye Paṇis, were arrow-proof, your words are weak for wounding; And were the path to you as yet unmastered, Soma in neither case will spare you.</p><p>Paved with the rock is this our treasure-chamber; filled full of precious things, of kine, and horses. These Paṇis who are watchful keepers guard it. In vain hast thou approached this lonely station.</p><p>Ṛṣis will come inspirited with Soma, Aṅgirases unwearied, and Navagvas. This stall of cattle will they part among them: then will the Paṇis wish these words unspoken.</p><p>Even thus, O Saramā, hast thou come hither, forced by celestial might to make the journey. Turn thee not back, for thou shalt be our sister: O Blest One, we will give thee of the cattle.</p><p>Brotherhood, sisterhood, I know not either: the dread Aṅgirases and Indra know them. They seemed to long for kine when I departed. Hence, into distance, be ye gone, O Paṇis.</p><p>Hence, far away, ye Paṇis! Let the cattle lowing come forth as holy Law commandeth, Kine which Soma, and Soma, Ṛṣis, sages, and pressing-stones have found when hidden.</p>
