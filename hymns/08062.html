<p>ROUSE ye for him who keeps the Law, yoke your steeds, A&#347;vins, to your car Let your protecting help be near.</p><p>Come, A&#347;vins, with your car more swift than is the twinkling of an eye Let your protecting help be near.</p><p>A&#347;vins, ye overlaid with cold the fiery pit for Atri's sake: Let your protecting help be near.</p><p>Where are ye? whither are ye gone? whither, like falcons, have ye flown? Let your protecting help be near.</p><p>If ye at any time this day are listening to this my call, Let your protecting help be near.</p><p>The A&#347;vins, first to hear our meditation, for closest kinship I approach: Let your protecting help be near.</p><p>For Atri ye, O A&#347;vins, made a dwelling-place to shield him well, Let your protecting help be near.</p><p>Ye warded off the fervent heat for Atri when he sweetly spake: Let your protecting help be near.</p><p>Erst Saptavadhri by his prayer obtained the trenchant edge of fire: Let your protecting help be near.</p><p>Come hither, O ye Lords of wealth, and listen to this call of mine: Let your protecting help be near.</p><p>What is this praise told forth of you as Elders in the ancient way? Let your protecting help be near.</p><p>One common brotherhood is yours, A&#347;vins your kindred is the same: Let your protecting help be near.</p><p>This is your chariot, A&#347;vins, which speeds through the regions, Earth and Heaven Let your protecting aid be near.</p><p>Approach ye hitherward to us with thousands both of steeds and kine: Let your protecting help be near.</p><p>Pass us not by, remember us with thousands both of kine and steeds: Let your protecting help be near.</p><p>The purple-tinted Dawn hath risen, and true to Law hath made the light Let your protecting help be near.</p><p>He looked upon the A&#347;vins, as an axe-armed man upon a tree: Let your protecting help be near.</p><p>By the black band encompassed round, break it down, bold one, like a fort.</p><p>Let your protecting help be near.</p>
