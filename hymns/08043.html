<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>THESE songs of mine go forth as lauds of Agni, the disposing Sage, whose worshipper is ne‚Äôer o‚Äôerthrown.</p><p>Wise Agni JƒÅtavedas, I beget a song of praise for thee.</p><p>Who willingly receivest it.</p><p>Thy sharpened flames, O Agni, like the gleams of light that glitter through, Devour the forests with their teeth.</p><p>Gold-coloured, bannered with the smoke, urged by the wind, aloft to Heaven Rise, lightly borne, the flames of fire.</p><p>These lightly kindled fiery flames are all around made visible, Even as the gleanings of the Dawns.</p><p>As JƒÅtavedas speeds along, the dust is black beneath his feet, when Agni spreads upon the Earth.</p><p>Making the plants his nourishment, Agni devours and wearies not, Seeking the tender shrubs again.</p><p>Bending him down with all his tongues, he flickers with his fiery glow Splendid is Agni in the woods.</p><p>Agni, thine home is in the floods: into the plants thou forcest way, and as their Child art born anew.</p><p>Worshipped with offerings shines thy flame, O Agni, from the sacred oil, with kisses on the ladle's mouth.</p><p>Let us serve Agni with our hymns, Disposer, fed on ox and cow, who bears the Soma on his back.</p><p>Yea, thee, O Agni, do we seek with homage and with fuel, Monk Whose wisdom is most excellent.</p><p>O worshipped with oblations, pure Agni, we call on thee as erst, Did Bh·πõgu, Manus, A·πÖgiras.</p><p>For thou, O Agni, by the fire, Sage by the Sage, Good by the Good, Friend by the Friend, art lighted up.</p><p>So wealth in thousands, food with store of heroes give thou to the sage, O Agni, to the worshipper.</p><p>O Agni, Brother, made by strength, Lord of red steeds and brilliant sway, Take pleasure in this laud of mine.</p><p>My praises, Agni, go to thee, as the cows seek the stall to meet, the lowing calf that longs for milk.</p><p>Agni, best A·πÖgiras, to thee all people who have pleasant homes, Apart, have turned as to their wish.</p><p>The sages skilled in holy song and thinkers with their thoughts have urged Agni to share the sacred feast.</p><p>So, Agni, unto thee the Monk, invoker, strong in forays, pray Those who spin out the offering.</p><p>In many a place, the same in look art thou, a Prince o‚Äôer all the tribes In battles we invoke thine aid.</p><p>Pray thou to Agni, pray to him who blazes served with sacred oil: Let him give ear to this our call.</p><p>We call on thee as such, as one who hears, as JƒÅtavedas, one, Agni! who beats away our foes.</p><p>I pray to Agni, King of men, the Wonderful, the President Of holy Laws. May he give ear.</p><p>Him like a bridegroom, him who stirs all people, like a noble horse, like a fleet steed, we instigate.</p><p>Slaying things deadly, burning up foes, RƒÅk·π£asas, on every side, Shine, Agni, with thy sharpened flame.</p><p>Thou whom the people kindle even as Manus did, best A·πÖgiras! O Agni, mark thou this my speech.</p><p>O Agni, made by strength! be thou born in the heavens or born in floods, as such we call on thee with songs.</p><p>Yea, all the people, all the folk who have good dwellings, each apart, Send food for thee to eat thereof.</p><p>O Agni, s. May we, devout, gazed at by men, throughout our days, Pass lightly over all distress.</p><p>We venerate with cheerful hearts the cheerful Agni, dear to all, Burning, with purifying flame.</p><p>So thou, O Agni rich in light, beaming like S≈´rya with thy rays Boldly demolishest the gloom,</p><p>We meditate to thee for this thy gift, Victor the gift that faileth not, O Agni, choicest wealth from thee.</p>
