<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>THE Ancient's Milch-cow yields the things we long for: the Son of Dak&#7779;i&#7751;&#257; travels between them.</p><p>She with the splendid chariot brings refulgence. The praise of U&#7779;as hath awoke the A&#347;vins.</p><p>They bear you hither by well-orderd statute: our sacred offerings rise as if to parents. Destroy in us the counsel of the niggard come hitherward, for we have shown you favour.</p><p>With lightly-rolling car and well-yoked horses hear this, the press-stone's song, ye Wonder-Workers. Have not the sages of old time, ye A&#347;vins, called you most prompt to come and stay misfortune?</p><p>Remember us, and come to us, forever men, as their wont is, invocate the A&#347;vins. Friends as it were have offered you these offerings, sweet, blent with milk at the first break of morning.</p><p>Even through many regions, O ye A&#347;vins high praise is yours among mankind, ye Mighty- Come, helpers, on the paths which Devas have travelled: here your libations of sweet meath are ready.</p><p>Ancient your home, auspicious is your friendship: Heroes, your wealth is with the house of Jahnu. Forming again with you auspicious friendship, let us rejoice with draughts of meath together.</p><p>O A&#347;vins, Very Mighty ones, with V&#257;yu and with his steeds, one-minded, ever-youthful, N&#257;satyas, joying in the third day's Soma, drink it, not hostile, Very Bounteous Givers.</p><p>A&#347;vins, to you are brought abundant offerings in rivalry with sacred songs, unceasing. Sprung from high Law your car, urged on by press-stones, goes round the Earth and Heaven in one brief moment.</p><p>A&#347;vins, your Soma sheds delicious sweetness: drink ye thereof and come unto our dwelling. Your car, assuming many a shape, most often goes to we's place of meeting.</p>
