<h2>HYMN LXI. Agni.</h2>

<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>PREPARE oblation: let him come; and let the minister serve again Who knows the ordering thereof,</p><p>Rejoicing in his friendship, let the Monk be seated over man, beside the shoot of active power.</p><p>Him, glowing bright beyond all thought, they seek among the race of man; With him for tongue they seize the food.</p><p>He hath inflamed the twofold plain: life-giving, he hath climbed the wood, and with his tongue hath struck the rock.</p><p>Wandering here the radiant Calf finds none to fetter him, and seeks The Mother to declare his praise.</p><p>And now that great and mighty team, the team of horses that are his, and traces of his car, are seen.</p><p>The seven milk a single cow; the two set other five to work, On the stream's loud-resounding bank.</p><p>Entreated by Vivasv&#257;n's ten, Indra cast down the water-jar With threefold hammer from the sky.</p><p>Three times the newly-kindled flame proceeds around the offering: The Monks anoint it with the meath.</p><p>With reverence they drain the fount that circles with its wheel above, Exhaustless, with the mouth below.</p><p>The pressing-stones are set at work: the meath is poured into the tank, At the out-shedding of the fount.</p><p>Ye cows, protect the fount: the two Mighty Ones bless the offering.</p><p>The handles twain are wrought of gold.</p><p>Pour on the juice the ornament which reaches both the Heaven and Earth Supply the liquid to the Bull.</p><p>These know their own abiding-place: like calves beside the mother cows They meet together with their kin.</p><p>Devouring in their greedy jaws, they make sustaining food in Heaven, to Indra, Agni light and prayer.</p><p>The Pious One milked out rich food, sustenance dealt in portions seven, together with the Sun's seven rays.</p><p>I took some Soma when the Sun rose up, O Mitra, Varu&#7751;a. That is the sick man's medicine.</p><p>From where oblations must be laid, which is the Well-beloved's home. He with his tongue hath compassed Heaven.</p>
