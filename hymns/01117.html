<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>A&#346;VINS, your ancient priest invites you hither to gladden you with draughts of meath of Soma.</p><p>Our gift is on the grass, our song apportioned: with food and strength come hither, O N&#257;satyas.</p><p>That car of yours, swifter than thought, O A&#347;vins, which drawn by brave steeds cometh to the people, Whereon ye seek the dwelling of the pious,&#151;come ye thereon to our abode, O Heroes.</p><p>Ye freed sage Atri, whom the Five Tribes honoured, from the strait pit, ye Heroes with his people, Baffling the guiles of the malignant Dasyu, repelling them, ye Mighty in succession.</p><p>Rebha the sage, ye mighty Heroes, A&#347;vins! whom, like a horse, vile men had sunk in water,&#151; Him, wounded, with your wondrous power ye rescued: your exploits of old time endure forever.</p><p>Ye brought forth Vandana, ye Wonder-Workers, for triumph, like fair gold that hath been buried, like one who slumbered in destruction's bosom, or like the Sun when dwelling in the darkness.</p><p>Kak&#7779;&#299;v&#257;n, Pajra's son, must laud that exploit of yours, N&#257;satyas. Heroes, ye who wander! When from the hoof of your strong horse ye showered a hundred jars of honey for the people.</p><p>To K&#7771;&#7779;&#7751;a's son, to Vi&#347;vaka who praised you, O Heroes, ye restored his son Vi&#7779;&#7751;&#257;p&#363;. To Gho&#7779;&#257;, living in her father's dwelling, stricken in years, ye gave a husband, A&#347;vins.</p><p>Ru&#7779;at&#299;, of the mighty people, A&#347;vins, ye gave to &#346;y&#257;va of the line of Ka&#7751;va. This deed of yours, ye Strong Ones should be published, that ye gave glory to the son of N&#7771;&#7779;ad.</p><p>O A&#347;vins, wearing many forms at pleasure, on Pedu ye bestowed a fleet-foot courser, Strong, winner of a thousand spoils, resistless the serpent slayer, glorious, triumphant.</p><p>These glorious things are yours, ye Bounteous Givers; prayer, praise in both worlds are your habitation. O A&#347;vins, when the sons of Pajra call you, send strength with nourishment to him who knoweth.</p><p>Hymned with the reverence of a son, O A&#347;vins ye Swift Ones giving booty to the singer, Glorified by Agastya with devotion established Vi&#347;pal&#257; again, N&#257;satyas.</p><p>Ye Sons of Heaven, ye Mighty, whither went ye, sought ye, for his fair praise the home of K&#257;vya. When, like a pitcher full of gold, O A&#347;vins, on the tenth day ye lifted up the buried?</p><p>Ye with the aid of your great powers, O A&#347;vins, restored to youth the ancient man Cyav&#257;na. The Daughter of the Sun with all her glory, O ye N&#257;satyas, chose your car to bear her.</p><p>Ye, ever-youthful Ones, again remembered Tugra, according to your ancient manner: With horses brown of hue that flew with swift wings ye brought back Bhujyu from the sea of billows.</p><p>The son of Tugra had invoked you, A&#347;vins; borne on he went uninjured through the ocean. Ye with your chariot swift as thought, well-harnessed, carried him off, O Mighty Ones, to safety.</p><p>The quail had invocated you, O A&#347;vins, when from the wolf's devouring jaws ye freed her. With conquering car ye cleft the mountain's ridges: the offspring of Vi&#347;v&#257;c ye killed with poison.</p><p>He whom for furnishing a hundred wethers to the she-wolf, his wicked father blinded,&#151; To him, &#7770;jr&#257;&#347;va, gave ye eyes, O A&#347;vins; light to the blind ye sent for perfect vision.</p><p>To bring the blind man joy thus cried the she-wolf: O A&#347;vins, O ye Mighty Ones, O Heroes, for me &#7770;jr&#257;&#347;va, like a youthful lover, hath. cut piecemeal one and a hundred wethers.</p><p>Great and weal-giving is your aid, O A&#347;vins, ye, objects of all thought, made whole the cripple. Purandhi also for this cause invoked you, and ye, O mighty, came to her with succours.</p><p>Ye, Wonder-Workers, filled with milk for &#346;ayu the milkless cow, emaciated, barren; And by your powers the child of Purumitra ye brought to Vimada to be his consort.</p><p>Ploughing and sowing barley, O ye A&#347;vins, milking out food for men, ye Wonder-Workers, Blasting away the Dasyu with your trumpet, ye gave far-spreading light unto the &#256;rya.</p><p>Ye brought the horse's head, A&#347;vins, and gave it unto Dadhyac the offspring of Atharvan. True, he revealed to you, O Wonder-Workers, sweet Soma, Tva&#7779;&#7789;ar's secret, as your girdle.</p><p>O Sages, evermore I crave your favour: be gracious unto all my meditations, O A&#347;vins. Grant me, N&#257;satyas, riches in abundance, wealth famous and accompanied with children.</p><p>With liberal bounty to the weakling's consorts ye. Heroes, gave a son Hira&#7751;yahasta; And &#346;y&#257;va, cut into three several pieces, ye brought to life again, O bounteous A&#347;vins.</p><p>These your heroic exploits, O ye A&#347;vins, done in the days. of old, have men related. May we, addressing prayer to you, ye Mighty, speak with brave sons about us to the synod.</p>
