<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>MIGHTY are ye, and far-extended. Heaven and Earth: both Worlds are evermore to us like two young Dames.</p><p>Guard us thereby from stronger foe; guard us hereby to give us strength.</p><p>In each succeeding offering that mortal honoureth the Devas. He who, most widely known and famed for happiness, inviteth them.</p><p>Ye who are Rulers over all, great is your sovran power as Devas. Ye all possess all majesty: all must be served in offering.</p><p>These are the joyous Kings of Immortality, Parijman, Mitra, Aryaman, and Indra. What else is Soma, praised of men? the Devas, Bhaga, Pūṣaṇa?</p><p>Come also to our dwelling, Lords of ample wealth, common partakers of our waters, Sun and Moon, when the great Dragon of the Deep hath settled down upon their floors.</p><p>And let the Aśvins, Lords of splendour, set us free.both Devas, and, with their Laws, Mitra and Indra. Through woes, as over desert lands, he speeds to ample opulence.</p><p>Yea, let the Aśvins Twain he gracious unto us, even Somas, and all Devas, Bhaga, Rathaspati; Parijman, Ṛbhu, Vāja, O Lords of all wealth Ṛbhukṣaṇas.</p><p>Prompt is Ṛbhukṣan, prompt the worshipper's strong drink. May thy fleet Bay Steeds, thine who speedest on, approach. Not mans but Deva's is offering whose psalm is unassailable.</p><p>O God Indra, harmed by none, lauded, give us a place among wealthy princes. With his Car-steeds at once 'hath our Indra guided the reins and the car of these men.</p><p>To these men present here, O Heaven and Earth, to us grant lofty fame extending over all mankind. Give us a steed to win us strength, a steed with wealth for victory.</p><p>This speaker, Indra—for thou art our Friend—wherever h. May be, guard thou, Victor! for help, ever for help Thy wisdom, Vasu! prosper him.</p><p>So have they strengthened this mine hymn which seems to take its bright path to the Sun, and reconciles the men: Thus forms a carpenter the yoke of horses, not to be displaced.</p><p>Whose chariot-seat hath come again laden with wealth and bright with gold, Lightly, with piercing ends, as ’twere two ranks of heroes ranged for fight.</p><p>This to Duḥśīma Pṛthavāna have I sung, to Vena, Rama, to the nobles, and the King. They yoked five hundred, and their love of us was famed upon their way.</p><p>Besides, they showed us seven-and-seventy horses here. Tānva at once displayed his gift, Pārthya at once displayed his gift; and straightway Māyava showed his.</p>
