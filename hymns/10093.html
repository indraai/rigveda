<h1>RigVeda Hymn 10093</h1>

<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>MIGHTY are ye, and far-extended, Heaven and Earth: both Worlds are evermore to us like two young Dames.</p><p>Guard us thereby from stronger foe; guard us hereby to give us strength.</p><p>In each succeeding offering that mortal honoureth the Devas, He who, most widely known and famed for happiness, inviteth them.</p><p>Ye who are Rulers over all, great is your sovran power as Devas. Ye all possess all majesty: all must be served in offering.</p><p>These are the joyous Kings of Immortality, Parijman, Mitra, Aryaman, and Varu&#7751;a. What else is Soma, praised of men? the Devas, Bhaga, P&#363;&#7779;a&#7751;a?</p><p>Come also to our dwelling, Lords of ample wealth, common partakers of our waters, Sun and Moon, when the great Dragon of the Deep hath settled down upon their floors.</p><p>And let the A&#347;vins, Lords of splendour, set us free,&#151;both Devas, and, with their Laws, Mitra and Varu&#7751;a. Through woes, as over desert lands, he speeds to ample opulence.</p><p>Yea, let the A&#347;vins Twain he gracious unto us, even Somas, and all Devas, Bhaga, Rathaspati; Parijman, &#7770;bhu, V&#257;ja, O Lords of all wealth &#7770;bhuk&#7779;a&#7751;as.</p><p>Prompt is &#7770;bhuk&#7779;an, prompt the worshipper's strong drink. May thy fleet Bay Steeds, thine who speedest on, approach. Not mans but Deva's is offering whose psalm is unassailable.</p><p>O God Indra, harmed by none, lauded, give us a place among wealthy princes. With his Car-steeds at once 'hath our Indra guided the reins and the car of these men.</p><p>To these men present here, O Heaven and Earth, to us grant lofty fame extending over all mankind. Give us a steed to win us strength, a steed with wealth for victory.</p><p>This speaker, Indra&#151;for thou art our Friend&#151;wherever h. May be, guard thou, Victor! for help, ever for help Thy wisdom, Vasu! prosper him.</p><p>So have they strengthened this mine hymn which seems to take its bright path to the Sun, and reconciles the men: Thus forms a carpenter the yoke of horses, not to be displaced.</p><p>Whose chariot-seat hath come again laden with wealth and bright with gold, Lightly, with piercing ends, as &#146;twere two ranks of heroes ranged for fight.</p><p>This to Du&#7717;&#347;&#299;ma P&#7771;thav&#257;na have I sung, to Vena, Rama, to the nobles, and the King. They yoked five hundred, and their love of us was famed upon their way.</p><p>Besides, they showed us seven-and-seventy horses here. T&#257;nva at once displayed his gift, P&#257;rthya at once displayed his gift; and straightway M&#257;yava showed his.</p>
