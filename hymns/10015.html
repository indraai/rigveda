<p>MAY they ascend, the lowest, highest, midmost, the Fathers who deserve a share of Soma- May they who have attained the life of spirits, gentle and righteous, aid us when we call them.</p><p>Now let us pay this homage to the Fathers, to those who passed of old and those who followed, Those who have rested in the earthly region, and those who dwell among the Mighty Races.</p><p>1 have attained the gracious-minded Fathers, I have gained son and progeny from Vi&#7779;&#7751;u.</p><p>They who enjoy pressed juices with oblation seated on sacred grass, come oftenest hither.</p><p>Fathers who sit on sacred grass, come, help us: these offerings have we made for you; accept them. So come to us with most auspicious favour, and give us health and strength without a trouble.</p><p>May they, the Fathers, worthy of the Soma, invited to their favourite oblations. Laid on the sacred grass, come nigh and listen. May they be gracious unto us and bless us.</p><p>Bowing your bended knees and seated southward, accept this offering of ours with favour. Punish us not for any sin, O Fathers, which we through human frailty have committed.</p><p>Lapped in the bosom of the purple Mornings, give riches to the man who brings oblations. Grant to your sons a portion of that treasure, and, present, give them energy, ye Fathers.</p><p>Our ancient Fathers who deserve the Soma, who came, most noble, to our Soma banquet,&#151; With these let Yama, yearning with the yearning, rejoicing eat our offerings at his pleasure.</p><p>Come to us, Agni, with the gracioug Fathers who dwell in glowing light, the very Kavyas, who thirsted mid the Devas, who hasten hither, oblation winners, theme of singers' praises.</p><p>Come, Agni, come with countless ancient Fathers, dwellers in light, primeval, God-adorers, Eaters and drinkers of oblations, truthful, who travel with the Deities and Indra.</p><p>Fathers whom Agni's flames have tasted, come ye nigh: ye kindly leaders, take ye each your proper place. Eat sacred food presented on the grass: grant riches with a multitude of hero sons.</p><p>Thou, Agni J&#257;tavedas, when entreated, didst bear the offerings which thou madest fragrant, and give them to the Fathers who did cat them with Svadha. Eat, thou Deva, the gifts we bring thee.</p><p>Thou, J&#257;tavedas, knowest well the number of Fathers who are here and who are absent, Of Fathers whom we know and whom we know not: accept the offering wellprepared with portions.</p><p>They who, consumed by fire or not cremated, joy in their offering in the midst of Heaven,&#151; Grant them, O Sovran Lord, the world of spirits and their own body, as thy pleasure wills it.</p>
