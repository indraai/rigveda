<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>SLIGHT us not Varu&#7751;a, Aryaman, or Mitra, &#7770;bhuk&#7779;an, Indra, &#256;yu, or the Devas, when we declare amid the congregation the virtues of the strong Steed, God-descended.</p><p>What time they bear before the Courser, covered with trappings and with wealth, the grasped oblation, the dappled goat goeth straightforward, bleating, to the place dear to Indra and to P&#363;&#7779;an.</p><p>Dear to all Devas, this goat, the share of P&#363;&#7779;an, is first led forward with the vigorous Courser, While Tva&#7779;&#7789;ar sends him forward with the Charger, acceptable for offering, to glory.</p><p>When thrice the men lead round the Steed, in order, who goeth to the Devas as meet oblation, the goat precedeth him, the share of P&#363;&#7779;an, and to the Devas the offering announceth.</p><p>Invoker, ministering priest, atoner, fire-kindler Soma-presser, sage, reciter, with this well ordered offering, well finished, do ye fill full the channels of the rivers.</p><p>The hewers of the post and those who carry it, and those who carve the knob to deck the Horse's stake; Those who prepare the cooking-vessels for the Steed,&#151;may the approving help of these promote our work.</p><p>Forth, for the regions of the Devas, the Charger with his smooth back is come my meditation attends him.</p><p>In him rejoice the singers and the sages. A good friend have we won for the Devas&#146; banquet.</p><p>May the fleet Courser's halter and his heel-ropes, the head-stall and the girths and cords about him. And the grass put within his mouth to bait him,&#151;among the Devas, too, let all these be with thee.</p><p>What part of the Steed's flesh the fly hath eaten, or is left sticking to the post or hatchet, or to the slayer's hands and nails adhereth,&#151;among the Devas, too. May all this be with thee.</p><p>Food undigested steaming from his belly, and any odour of raw flesh remaining, This let the immolators set in order and dress the offering with perfect cooking.</p><p>What from thy body which with fire is roasted, when thou art set upon the spit, distilleth, Let not that lie on Earth or grass neglected, but to the longing Devas let all be offered.</p><p>They who observing that the Horse is ready call out and say, the smell is good; remove it; And, craving meat, await the distribution,&#151;may their approving help promote labour.</p><p>The trial-fork of the flesh-cooking caldron, the vessels out of which the broth is sprinkled, the warming-pots, the covers of the dishes, hooks, carving-boards,&#151;all these attend the Charger.</p><p>The starting-place, his place of rest and rolling, the ropes wherewith the Charger's feet were fastened, the water that he drank, the food he tasted,&#151;among the Devas, too. May all these attend thee.</p><p>Let not the fire, smoke-scented, make thee crackle, nor glowing caldron smell and break to pieces. Offered, beloved, approved, and consecrated,&#151;such Charger do the Devas accept with favour.</p><p>The robe they spread upon the Horse to clothe him, the upper covering and the golden trappings, the halters which restrain the Steed, the heel-ropes,&#151;all these, as grateful to the Devas, they offer.</p><p>If one, when seated, with excessive urging hath with his heel or with his whip distressed thee, All these thy woes, as with the oblations' ladle at offers, with my meditation I banish.</p><p>The four-and-thirty ribs of the. Swift Charger, kin to the Devas, the slayer's hatchet pierces. Cut ye with skill, so that the parts be flawless, and piece by piece declaring them dissect them.</p><p>Of Tva&#7779;&#7789;ar's Charger there is one dissector,&#151;this is the custom-two there are who guide him. Such of his limbs as I divide in order, these, amid the balls, in fire I offer.</p><p>Let not thy dear soul burn thee as thou comest, let not the hatchet linger in thy body. Let not a greedy clumsy immolator, missing the joints, mangle thy limbs unduly.</p><p>No, here thou diest not, thou art not injured: by easy paths unto the Devas thou goest. Both Bays, both spotted mares are now thy fellows, and to the ass's pole is yoked the Charger.</p><p>May this Steed bring us all-sustaining riches, wealth in good kine, good horses, manly offspring. Freedom from si. May Aditi vouchsafe us: the Steed with our oblations gain us lordship!</p>
