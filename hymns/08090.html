<div class="box hymn"><p>YEA, specially that mortal man hath toiled for service of the Devas, who quickly hath brought near Mitra and Indra. to share his sacrificial gifts.</p><p>Supreme in sovran power, far-sighted, Chiefs and Kings, most swift to hear from far away, Both, wondrously, set them in motion as with arms, in company with SÅ«rya's beams.</p><p>The rapid messenger who runs before you with iron head, swift to the draught,</p><p>He whom no ma. May question, non. May summon back, who stands not still for colloquy. From hostile clash with him keep ye us safe this day: keep us in safety with your arms.</p><p>To Aryaman and Mitra sing a reverent song, O pious one, a pleasant hymn that shall protect to Indra: sing forth a laud unto the Kings.</p><p>The true, Red Treasure they have sent, one only Son born of the Three.</p><p>They, the Immortal Ones, never deceived, survey the families of mortal men.</p><p>My songs are lifted up, and acts most splendid are to be performed. Come hither, with accordant mind, to meet and to enjoy my gifts.</p><p>Lords of great wealth, when we invoke your bounty which no demon checks, Both of you, furthering our eastward-offcred praise, come, Chiefs whom Jamadagni lauds!</p><p>Come, Soma, drawn by fair hymns, to our offering that reaches Heaven. Poured on the middle of the strainingcloth, and cooked, this bright drink hath been offered ilice.</p><p>He comes by straightest paths, as ministering Monk, to taste the sacrificial gifts. Then, Lord of harnessed teams I drink of the twofold draught, bright Soma mingled with the milk.</p><p>Verily, SÅ«rya, thou art great; truly, Ä€ditya, thou art great. As thou art great indeed, thy greatness is admired: yea, verily Deva, art great.</p><p>Yea, SÅ«rya, thou art great in fame thou evermore, art great. Thou by thy greatness art the Devasâ€™ High Monk, divine, far-spread unconquerable light.</p><p>She yonder, bending lowly down, clothed in red hues and rich in rays, is seen, advancing as it were with various tints, amid the ten surrounding arms.</p><p>Past and gone are three mortal generations: the fourth and last into the Sun hath entered. He mid the worlds his lofty place hath taken. Into green plants is gone the Purifying.</p><p>The Somas' Mother, Daughter of the Devas, centre of nectar, the Ä€dityasâ€™ Sister- To folk who understand will 1 proclaim it-injure not Aditi, the Cow, the sinless.</p><p>Weak-minded men have as a cow adopted me who came hither from the Devas, a Goddess, who, skilled in eloquence, her voice uplifteth, who standeth near at hand with all devotions.</p>
