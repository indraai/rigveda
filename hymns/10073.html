<main>
<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>THOU wast born mighty for victorious valour, exulting, strongest, full of pride and courage.</p><p>There, even there, the Devas strengthened Indra when. his most rapid Mother stirred the Hero.</p><p>There with fiend's ways e&#146;en P&#7771;&#347;ni was seated: with much laudation they exalted Indra. As if encompassed by the Mighty-footed, from darkness, near at hand, forth came the Children.</p><p>High are thy feet when on thy way thou goest: the strength thou foundest here hath lent thee vigour. Thousand hyenas in thy mouth thou holdest. O Indra, mayst thou turn the A&#347;vins hither.</p><p>Speeding at once to offering thou comest for friendship thou art bringing both N&#257;satyas. Thou hadst a thousand treasures in possession. The A&#347;vins, O thou Hero, gave thee riches.</p><p>Glad, for the race that rests on holy Order, with friends who hasten to their goal, hath Indra With these his magic powers assailed the Dasyu: he cast away the gloomy mists, the darkness.</p><p>Two of like name for him didst thou demolish, as Indra striking down the car of U&#7779;as. With thy beloved lofty Friends thou camest, and with the assurance of thine heart thou slewest.</p><p>War-loving Namuci thou smotest, robbing the D&#257;sa of his magic for the &#7770;&#7779;i. For man thou madest ready pleasant pathways, paths leading as it were directly God-ward.</p><p>These names of thine thou hast fulfilled completely: as Lord, thou boldest in thine arm, O Indra. In thee, through thy great mights are joyful: the roots of trees hast thou directed upward.</p><p>May the sweet Soma juices make him happy to cast his quoit that lies in depth of waters. Thou from the udder which o&#146;er Earth is fastened hast poured the milk into the kine and herbage.</p><p>When others call him offspring of the Courser, my meaning is that Mighty Power produced him. He came from Manyu and remained in houses: whence he hath sprung is known to Indra only.</p><p>Like birds of beauteous wing the Priyamedhas, &#7770;&#7779;is, imploring, have come nigh to Indra: Dispel the darkness and fill full our vision deliver us as men whom snares entangle.</p>
