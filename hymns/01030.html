<h2>HYMN XXX. Indra.</h2>

<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>WE fill full your Indra like a well, most liberal, Lord of Hundred Powers,</p><p>Who lets a hundred of the pure, a thousand of the milk-blent draughts Flow, even as down a depth, to him;</p><p>When for the strong, the rapturous joy he in this manner hath made room within his belly, like the sea.</p><p>This is thine own. Thou drawest near, as turns a pigeon to his mate: Thou carest too for this our meditation.</p><p>O Hero, Lord of Bounties, praised in hymns. May power and joyfulness Be his who sings the laud to thee.</p><p>Lord of a Hundred Powers, stand up to lend us assist in this fight In others too let us agree.</p><p>In every need, in every fray we call as friends to assist us Indra the mightiest of all.</p><p>If he will hear us let him come with assist of a thousand kinds, and all that strengthens, to our call.</p><p>I call him mighty to resist, the Hero of our ancient home, thee whom my sire invoked of old.</p><p>We meditate to thee, O much-invoked, rich in all precious gifts, O Friend, Kind Deva to those who sing thy praise.</p><p>O Soma-drinker, Thunder-armed, Friend of our lovely-featured dames And of our Soma-drinking friends.</p><p>Thus, Soma-drinker. May it be; thus, Friend, who wieldest thunder, act To aid each wish as we desire.</p><p>With Indra splendid feasts be ours, rich in all strengthening things wherewith, Wealthy in food, we may rejoice.</p><p>Like thee, thyself, the singers' Friend, thou movest, as it were, besought, Bold One, the axle of the car.</p><p>That, Åšatakratu, thou to grace and please thy praisers, as it were, Stirrest the axle with thy strength.</p><p>With champing, neighing loudly-snorting horses Indra hath ever won himself great treasures. A car of gold hath he whose deeds are wondrous received from us, and let us too receive it.</p><p>Come, Indra, with enduring strength wealthy in horses and in kine, and gold, O ye of wondrous deeds.</p><p>Your chariot yoked for both alike, immortal, ye of mighty acts, travels, O Indra, in the sea.</p><p>High on the forehead of the Bull one chariot wheel ye ever keep, the other round the sky revolves.</p><p>What mortal enjoyeth thee? Where lovest thou? To whom, O radiant, dost thou go?</p><p>For we have had thee in our thoughts whether anear or far away.</p><p>Hither, come thou with these thy strengthenings, and send thou riches down to us.</p>
