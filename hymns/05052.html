<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>SING boldly forth, Śyāvāśva, with the Devas who are loud in song, who, holy, as their wont is, joy in glory that is free from guile.</p><p>For in their boldness they are friends of firm and sure heroic strength.</p><p>They in their course, bold-spirited, guard all men of their own accord.</p><p>Like steers in rapid motion they advance and overtake the nights; And thus the Devas’ power in Heaven and on the Earth we celebrate.</p><p>With boldness to your Devas let us offer laud and offering: Who all, through ages of mankind, guard mortal man from injury.</p><p>Praiseworthy, givers of good gifts. Heroes with full and perfect strength - To Devas, Holy Ones of Heaven, will I extol the offering.</p><p>The lofty Heroes cast their spears and weapons bright with gleaming gold. After these Devas followed close, like laughing lightning from the sky, a splendour of its own accord.</p><p>They who waxed mighty, of the Earth, they who are in the wide mid-air, or in the rivers’ compass, or in the abode of ample Heaven.</p><p>Praise thou the Devas’ company, the valorous and truly strong, the Heroes, hasting, by themselves have yoked their deer for victory.</p><p>Fair-gleaming, on Paruṣṇī they have clothed themselves in robes of wool, and with their chariot tires they cleave the rock asunder in their might.</p><p>Whether as wanderers from the way or speeders on or to the path, Under these names the spreading band tend well the offering for me.</p><p>To this the Heroes well attend, well do their teams attend to this. Visible are their varied forms. Behold, they are Paravatas.</p><p>Hymn-singing, seeking water, they, praising, have danced about the spring. What are they unto me? No thieves, but helpers, splendid to behold.</p><p>Sublime, with lightnings for their spears, Sages and Orderers are they. Ṛṣi, adore that Marut host, and make them happy with thy song.</p><p>Ṛṣi, invite the Marut band with offerings, as a maid her friend. From Heaven, too, Bold Ones, in your might haste hither glorified with songs.</p><p>Thinking of these now let him come, as with the escort of the Devas, and with the splendid Princes, famed for rapid courses, to the gifts.</p><p>Princes, who, when I asked their kin, named Pṛśni as their Mother-cow, and the impetuous Soma they, the Mighty Ones, declared their Sire.</p><p>The mighty ones, the seven times seven, have singly given me hundred gifts. I have obtained on Yamuna famed wealth in kine and wealth in steeds.</p>
