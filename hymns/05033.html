<div class="box hymn"><p>GREAT praise to Indra, great and strong mid heroes, I ponder thus, the feeble to the Mighty, who with his band shows favour to this people, when lauded, in the fight where spoil is gathered.</p><p>So made attentive by our hymns, Steer! Indra! thou fastenedst the girth of thy Bay Coursers, Which, Indra, at thy will thou drivest hither. With these subdue for us the men who hate us.</p><p>They were not turned to us-wtrd, lofty Indra! while yet through lack of prayer they stood unharnessed.</p><p>Ascend this chariot, thou whose hand wields thunder, and draw the rein, O Lord of noble horses.</p><p>Thou, because many lauds are thine, O Indra, wast active warring in the fields for cattle. For Sūrya in his own abode thou. Hero, formedst in fights even a Dāsa's nature.</p><p>Thine are we, Indra; thine are all these people, conscious of might, whose cars are set in motion. Some hero come to us, O Strong as Ahi beauteous in war, to be invoked like Bhaga.</p><p>Strength much to be desired is in thee, Indra: the Immortal dances forth his hero exploits. Such, Lord of Treasure, give us splendid riches. I praise the Friend's gift, his whose wealth is mighty.</p><p>Thus favour us, O Indra, with ihy assist; Hero, protect the bards who sing thy praises. Be friendly in the fray to those who offer the skin of beautiful and well-pressed Soma.</p><p>And these ten steeds which Trasadasyu gives me, the goldrich chief, the son of Purukutsa, Resplendent in their brightness shall convey me. Gairiksita willed it and so came I hither.</p><p>And these, bestowed as sacrificial guerdon, the powerful tawny steeds of Marutasva; And thousands which kind Cyavatana gave me, abundantly bestowed for my adornment.</p><p>And these commended horses, bright and active, by Dhvanya son of Laksmana presented, Came unto me, as cows into the Ṛṣi Samvarana's stall, with magnitude of riches.</p>
