<div class="box hymn"><p>HE who gives food, like patrimonial riches and guides aright like some wise man's instruction, Loved like a guest who lies in pleasant lodging.may he, as Monk, prosper his servant's dwelling.</p><p>He who like Indra the Deva, true-minded protecteth with his power. all acts of vigour, Truthful, like splendour, glorified by many, like breath joy-giving.all must strive to win him.</p><p>He who on Earth dwells like a king surrounded by faithful friends, like a Deva all-sustaining, like heroes who preside, who sit in safety: like as a blameless dame dear to her husband.</p><p>Thee, such, in settlements secure, O Agni, our men serve ever kindled in each dwelling.</p><p>On him have they laid splendour in abundance: dear to all men, bearer be he of riches.</p><p>May thy rich worshippers win food, O Agni, and princes gain long life who bring oblation. May we get booty from our foe in battle, presenting to the Devas their share for glory.</p><p>The cows of holy law, sent us by Heaven, have swelled with laden udders, loudly lowing; Soliciting his favour, from a distance the rivers to the rock have flowed together.</p><p>Agni, with thee, soliciting thy favour, the holy Ones have gained glory in Heaven. They made the Night and Dawn of different colours, and set the black and purple hues together.</p><p>May we and those who worship be the mortals whom thou, O Agni, leadest on to riches. Thou hast filled Earth and Heaven and air's mid-region, and followest the whole world like a shadow.</p><p>Aided by thee, O Agni. May we conquer steeds with steeds, men with men, heroes with heroes, Lords of the wealth transmitted by our fathers: an. May our princes live a hundred winters.</p><p>May these our hymns of praise, Agni, ordainer, be pleasant to thee in thy heart and spirit. May we have power to hold thy steeds of riches, laying on thee the Deva-sent gift of glory.</p>
