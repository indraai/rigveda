<h1>RigVeda Hymn 10079</h1>

<main>
<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>I HAVE beheld the might of this Great Being. Immortal in the midst of tribes of mortals.</p><p>His jaws now open and now shut together: much they devour, insatiately chewing.</p><p>His eyes are turned away, his head is hidden: unsated with his tongue he eats the fuel. With hands upraised, with reverence in the houses, for him they quickly bring his food together.</p><p>Seeking, as &#146;twere, his Mother's secret bosom, he, like a child, creeps on through wide-spread bushes. One he finds glowing like hot food made ready, and kissing deep within the Earth's recmes.</p><p>This holy Law I tell you, Earth and Heaven: the Infant at his birth dovours his Parents. No knowledge of the Deva have I, a mortal. Yea, Agni knoweth best, for he hath wisdom.</p><p>This man who quickly gives him food, who offers his gifts of oil and butter and supports him, - Him with his thousand eyes he closely looks on: thou showest him thy face from all sides, Agni.</p><p>Agni, hast thou committed sin or treason among the Devas? In ignorance I ask thee. Playing, not playing, he gold-hued and toothless, hath cut his food up as the knife a victim.</p><p>He born in wood hath yoked his horses rushing in all directions, held with reins that glitter. The well-born friend hath carved his food with Devas: in all his limbs he hath increased and prospered.</p>
