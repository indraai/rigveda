<p>To meet your treasure-bringing car, the mighty car most dear to us, A&#347;vins, the &#7770;&#7779;i is prepared, your raiser, with his song of praise. Lovers of sweetness, hear my call.</p><p>Pass, O ye A&#347;vins, pass away beyond all tribes of selfish men, Wonderful, with your golden paths, most gracious, bringers of the flood. Lovers of sweetness, hear my call.</p><p>Come to us, O ye A&#347;vin Pair, bringing your precious treasures, come Ye Somas, on your paths of gold, rejoicing, rich in store of wealth. Lovers of sweetness, hear my call.</p><p>O strong and Good, the voice of him who lauds you well cleaves to your car.</p><p>And that great beast, your chariot-steed, fair, wonderful, makes dainty food. Lovers of sweetness, hear my call.</p><p>Watchful in spirit, born on cars, impetuous, listing to his cry, A&#347;vins, with winged steeds ye speed down to cyavana void of guile. Lovers of sweetness, hear my call.</p><p>Hither, O Heroes, let your steeds, of dappled hue, yoked at the thought, Your flying steeds, O A&#347;vins, bring you hitherward, with bliss, to drink. Lovers of sweetness, hear my call.</p><p>O A&#347;vins, hither come to us; N&#257;satyas, be not disinclined. Through longing for the pious turn out of the way to reach our home. Lovers of sweetness, bear my call.</p><p>Ye Lords of Splendour, free from guile, come, stand at this our offering. Beside the singer, A&#347;vins, who longs for your grace and lauds you both. Lovers of sweetness, hear my call.</p><p>Dawn with her white herd hath appeared, and in due time hath fire been placed. Harnessed is your immortal car, O WonderWorkers, strong and kind. Lovers of sweetness, bear my call.</p>
