<h1>HYMN CLXXXVI. Devas.</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>LOVED of all men, may Indra, through praises offered as sacred food, come to our synod, that you too, through-our hymn, ye ever-youthful, may gladden, at your visit, all our people.</p><p>To us may all the Devas come trooped together, Indra concordant, that all may be promoters of our welfare, and with great might preserve our strength from slackness.</p><p>Agni I sing, the guest you love most dearly: the Conqueror through our lauds is friendly-minded.</p><p>That he may be our Indra rich in glory and send food like a prince praised by the Deva.</p><p>To you I seek with reverence, Night and Morning, like a cow good to milkpreparing on a common day the praise. song with milk of various hues within this udder.</p><p>May the great Dragon of the Deep rejoice us: as one who nourishes her young comes Sindhu, with whom we will incite the Child of Waters whom vigorous course swift as thought bring hither.</p><p>Moreover Indra also shall approach us, one-minded with the princes at his visit. Hither shall come Indra, Ruler of men, as strongest of the Heroes.</p><p>Him too our hymns delight, that yoke swift horses, like mother cows who lick their tender youngling. To him our songs shall yield themselves like spouses, to him the most delightful of the Heroes.</p><p>So may the Devas rest here on Heaven and Earth with hearts in concord, as Devas whose cars have dappled steeds like torrents.</p><p>They hasten on to happy termination their orders when they are made known by glory. As on a fair bright day the arrow missiles sparkle.</p><p>Incline the AÅ›vins to show grace for power and might have they, their own possession. Friendly are Indra and the Devas to make us happy.</p><p>This is my reverent thought of you, may it inspire you, make you dwell among us. Thought, toiling for the Devas and seeking treasure. May we find strengthening food in full abundance.</p>
