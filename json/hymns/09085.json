Smite thou our enemies who raise the shout of joy: Indra, drink Soma juice, and drive away our foes.\np:Unharmed, best Cheerer, thou, O Indu, flowest on: thou, even thou thyself, art Indra's noblest food. Full many a wise man lifts to thee the song of praise, and hails thee with a kiss as Sovran of this world.\np:Wondrous, with hundred streams, hymned in a thousand songs, Indu pours out for Indra his delightrul meath. Winning us land and waters, flow thou hitherward: Rainer of bounties, Soma, make broad way for us.\np:Roaring within the beaker thou art balmed with milk: thou passest through the fleecy filter all at once. Carefully cleansed and decked like a prizewinning steed, O Soma, thou hast flowed down within Indra's throat.\np:Flow onward sweet of flavour for the Heavenly Race, for Indra sweet, whose name is easily invoked: Flow sweet for Mitra, Indra, and Soma, rich in meath, inviolable for Soma.\np:Ten rapid fingers deck the Courser in the jar: with hymns the holy singers send their voices forth. The filtering juices hasten to their eulogy, the drops that gladden find their way to Indra's heart.\np:While thou art purified pour on us hero strength, great, far-extended shelter, spacious pasturage. Let no oppression master this our holy work. May we, O Indu, gain all opulence through thee.\np:The Steer who sees afar hath risen above the sky: the Sage hath caused the lights of Heaven to give their shine. The. King is passing through the filter with a roar: they drain the milk of Heaven from him who looks on men.\np:High in the vault of Heaven, unceasing, honey-tongued, the Loving Ones drain out the mountain-haunting Steer,â€” The drop that hath grown great in waters, in the lake meath-rich, in the stream's wave and in the cleansing sieve.\np:The Loving Ones besought with many voices the Eagle who had flown away to Heaven. Hymns kiss the Youngling worthy of laudation, resting on Earth, the Bird of golden colour.\np:High to Heaven's vault hath the Gandharva risen, beholding all his varied forms and figures. His ray hath shone abroad with gleaming splendour: pure, he hath lighted both the worlds, the Parents.",
