May precious goods come nigh to us in thousands.\r\np:May the most sapient Devas, with protection, with best boons brought from lofty Heaven, approach . Now when their team of the most noble horses speeds even on the sea's extremest limit.\np:Close to them clings one moving in seclusion, like a man's wife, like a spear carried rearward, well grasped, bright, decked with gold there is V&#257;k also, like to a courtly, eloquent dame, among them.\np:Far off the brilliant, never-weary Devas cling to the young Maid as a joint possession. The fierce Devas drave not Rodas&#299; before them, but wished for her to grow their friend and fellow.\np:When chose immortal Rodas&#299; to follow&#151;she with loose tresses and heroic spirit&#151; She climbed her servant's chariot, she like S&#363;rya with cloud-like motion and refulgent aspect.\np:Upon their car the young men set the Maiden wedded to glory, mighty in assemblies, when your song, Devas, rose, and, with oblation, the Soma-pourer sang his hymn in worship.\np:I will declare the greatness of these Devas, their real greatness, worthy to be lauded. How, with them, she though firm, strong-minded, haughty, travels to women happy in their fortune.\np:Mitra and Varu&#7751;a they guard from censure. Firm things are overthrown that ne&#146;er were shaken: he prospers, Devas, who gives choice oblations.\np:None of us, Devas, near or at a distance, hath ever reached the limit of your vigour. They in courageous might still waxing boldly have compassed round their foemen like an ocean.\np:May we this day be dearest friends of Indra, and let us call on him in fight to-morrow.
