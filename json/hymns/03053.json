With sweetest song I grasp, O Mighty Indra, thy garment's hem as a child grasps his father's.\np:Adhvaryu, sing we both; sing thou in answer: make we a laud acceptable to Indra. Upon this offerer's grass he seated: to Indra shall our eulogy be uttered.\np:A wife, O Indra is home and dwelling: so let thy Bay Steeds yoked convey thee hither. Whenever we press out for thee the Soma, let Agni as our Herald speed to call thee.\np:Depart, O Indra;again come hither: both there and here thy goat is Indra, Brother, Where thy tall chariot hath a place to rest in, and where thqu loosest thy loud-neighing Courser.\np:Thou hast drunk Soma, Indra, turn thee homeward; thy joy is in thy home, thy racious Consort; Where thy tall chariot hath a place to rest in, and thy strong Courser is set free with guerdon.\np:Bounteous are these, Aṅgirases, Virupas: the Devas's Heroes and the Sons of Heaven. They, giving store of wealth to Viśvāmitra, prolong his life through countless Soma-pressings.\np:Indra weareth every shape at pleasure, effecting magic changes in his body, Holy One, drinker out of season, coming thrice, in a moment, through fit prayers, from Heaven.\np:The mighty sage, Deva-born and Deva-incited, who looks on men, restrained the billowy river. When Viśvāmitra was Sudās's escort, then Indra through the Kuśikas grew friendly.\np:Like swans, prepare a song of praise with pressing-stones, glad in your hymns with juice poured forth in offering. Ye singers, with the Devas, sages who look on men, ye Kutikas drink up the Soma's savoury meath.\np:Come forward, Kuśikas, and be attentive; let loose Sudās's horse to win him riches. East, west, and north, let the King subdue the foeman, then at Earth's choicest place perform his worship.\np:Praises to Indra have I sung, sustainer of this Earth and Heaven. This prayer of Viśvāmitra keeps secure the race of Bharatas.\np:The Viśvāmitras have sung forth this prayer to Indra Thunder-aimed: So let him make us prosperous.\np:Among the Kikatas what do thy cattle? They pour no milky draught, they heat no caldron. Bring thou to us the wealth of Pramaganda;give up to us, O Indra, the low-born.\np:Sasarpari, the gift of Jamadagnis, hath lowed with mighty voice dispelling famine. The Daughter of the Sun hath spread our glory among the Devas, imperishable, deathless.\np:Sasarpari brought glory speedily to these, over the generations of the Fivefold Race; Daughter of Paksa, she bestows new vital power, she whom the ancient Jamadagnis gave to me.\np:Strong be the pair of oxen, firm the axles, let not the pole slip nor the yoke be broken. May Indra, keep the yoke-pins from decaying: attend us, thou whose fellies are uninjured.\np:O Indra, give our bodies strength, strength to the bulls who draw the wains, Strength to our seed and progeny that the, may live, for thou art he who giveth strength.\np:Enclose thee in the heart of Khayar timber, in the car wrought of Sinsapa put firmness. Show thyself strong, O Axle, fixed and strengthened: throw us not from the car whereon we travel.\np:Let not this sovran of the wood leave us forlorn or injure us. Saf. May we be until we reach our homes and rest us and unyoke.\np:With various aids this day come to us, Indra, with best aids speed us, Indra, thou Hero. Let him who hatcth us fall headlong downward: him whom we hate let vital breath abandon.\np:He heats his very axe, and then cuts a mere Semal blossom off. O Indra, like a caldron cracked and seething, so he pours out foam.\np:Men notice not the arrow, O ye people; they bring the red beast deeming it a bullock. A sluggish steed men run not with the courser, nor ever lead an ass before a charger.\np:These men, the sons of Bhārata, O Indra, regard not severance or close connexion. They urge their own steed as it were another's, and take him, swift as the bow's string, to battle.",
