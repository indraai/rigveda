As such, most friendly, thou art every day extolled in lauds by Vitahavya, O thou wondrous God.\np:Be thou the foeless helper of the skilful man, subduer of the enemy near or far away. Bestow a wealthy home on men, O Son of Strength. Give Vitahavya riches spreading far and wide, give Bharadvāja wide-spread wealth.\np:Him, your refulgent guest, Agni who comes from Heaven, the Herald of mankind, well-skilled in sacred rites, who, like a holy singer, utters heavenly words, oblation-bearer, envoy, Deva, I seek with hymns.\np:Who with his purifying, eye-attracting form hath shone upon the Earth as with the light of Dawn. Who speeding on, as in the fight of Etaia, cometh, untouched by age, as one athirst in heat.\np:Worship ye Agni, Agni, with your log of wood; praise your beloved, your beloved guest with songs. Invite ye the Immortal hither with your hymns. A God among the Devas, he loveth what is choice, loveth our service, God mid Devas.\np:Agni inflamed with fuel in my song I sing, pure, Cleanser, steadlast, set in tront at offering. Wise Jātavedas we implore with prayers for bliss the Monk, the holy Singer, bounteous, void of guile.\np:Men, Agni, in each age have made thee, Deathiess One, their envoy, offering-bearer, guard adorable. With reverence Devas and mortals have established thee, the ever-watchful, omnipresent Household Lord.\np:Thou, Agni, ordering the works and ways of both, as envoy of the Devas traversest both the worlds. When we lay claim to thy regard and gracious fare, be thou to us a thriceprotecting friendly guard.\np:Him fair of face, rapid, and fair to look on, him very wis. May we who know not follow. Let him who knows all rules invite for worship, Agru announce our offering to the Immortals.\np:Him, Agni, thou deliverest and savest who brings him prayer to thee the Wise, O Hero, the end of offering or its inception; yea, thou endowest him with power and riches.\np:Guard us from him who would assail us, preserve us, O thou Victor, from dishonour. May wealth be ours, desirable in thousands.\np:Agni, the Monk, is King, Lord of the homestead, he, Jatayedas, knows all generations. Most skilful worshipper mid Devas and mortals. May he begin the offering, the Holy.\np:Whate’er to-day thou, bright-flamed Monk, enjoyest from the man's rite-for thou art offerer- Worship, for duly dost thou spread in greatness: bear off thine ofrerings of to-day, most Youthful.\np:Look thou upon the offerings duly laid for thee. Fain would he set thee here to worship Heaven and,Earth. Help us, O liberal Agni, in the strife for spoil, so that we may o’ercome all things that trouble us, o’ercome, o’ercome them with thy help.\np:Together with all Devas, O fair-faced Agni, be seated first upon the woollined altar, Nest-like, bedewed with oil. Bear this our worship to Indra who offers rightly.\np:Here the arranging monks, as did Atharvan, rub this Agni forth, whom, not bewildered, as he moved in winding ways, they brought from gloom.\np:For the Devas’ banquet be thou born, for full perfection and for weal. Bring the Immortal Devas who strengthen holy Law: so let our offering reach the Devas.\np:O Agni, Lord and Master of men's homesteads, with kindled fuel we have made thee mighty. Let not our household gear be found defective. Sharpen us with thy penetrating splendour.",
