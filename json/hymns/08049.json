To Agni, Child of Force, whose locks drop oil, we seek, foremost in sacrificial rites.\np:Agni, thou art Disposer, Sage. Herald, bright God! and worshipful, best offerer, cheerful, to be praised in holy rites, pure Lord! by singers with their hymns.\np:Most Youthful and Eternal, bring the longing Devas to me, the guileless, for the feast. Come, Vasu, to the banquet that is well-prepared: rejoice thee, gracious, with our songs.\np:Famed art thou, Agni, far and wide, Preserver, righteous, and a Sage. The holy singers, O refulgent kindled God! arrangers, call on thee to come.\np:Shine, most Resplendent! blaze, send bliss unto the folk, and to thy worshipper Great art thou. May my princes, with good fires, subduing foes, rest in the keeping of the Devas.\np:O Agni, as thou burnest down to Earth even high-grown underwood, So, bright as Mitra is, burn him who injures us, him who plots ill against thy friend.\np:Give us not as a prey to mortal enemy, nor to the wicked friend of fiends.

Unweariedly thou bearest up the offerer's gifts, then shinest bright among the Devas.\np:And so the seven monks, O Agni, worship thee, free-giver, Everlasting One. Thou cleavest through the rock with heat and fervent glow. Agni, rise up above the men.\np:For you let us whose grass is trimmed call Agni, Agni, restless God. Let us whose food is offered call to all the tribes Agni the Invoking Monk of men.\np:Agni, with noble psalm that tells his wish he dwells, thinking on thee who guardest him. Speedily bring us strength of many varied sorts to be most near to succour us.\np:Agni, Praise-singer!
