Thou on my right shalt be my friend and comrade: then shall we two smite dead full many a foeman.\np:Striving for strength bring forth a laud to Indra, a truthful hymn if he in truth existeth. One and another say, there is no Indra. Who hath beheld him? Whom then shall we honour?\np:Here am I, look upon me here, O singer. All that existeth 1 surpass in greatness. The Holy Law's commandments make me mighty. Rending with strength I rend the worlds asunder.\np:When the Law's lovers mounted and ap. proached me as 1 sate lone upon the dear sky's summit. Then spake my spirit to the heart within me, My friends have cried unto me with their children.\np:All these thy deeds must be declared at Soma-feasts, wrought, Indra, Bounteous Lord, for him who sheds the juice, when thou didst open wealth heaped up by many, brought from far away to Sarablia, the &#7770;&#7779;i's kin.\np:Now run ye forth your several ways: he is not here who kept you back. For hath not Indra sunk his bolt deep down in V&#7771;tra's vital part?\np:On-rushing with the speed of thought within the iron fort he pressed: The Falcon went to Heaven and brought the Soma to the Thunderer.\np:Deep in the ocean lies the bolt with waters compassed round about, and in continuous onward flow the floods their tribute bring to it.\np:When, uttering words which no one comprehended, V&#257;k, Queen of Devas, the Gladdener, was seated, the Heaven's four regions drew forth drink and vigour: now whither hath her noblest portion vanished?\np:The Deities generated V&#257;k the Goddess, and animals of every figure speak her. May she, the Gladdener, yielding food and vigour, the Milch-cow V&#257;k, approach us meetly lauded.\np:Step forth with wider stride, my comrade Vi&#7779;&#7751;u; make room, Devas, for the leaping of the lightning.
