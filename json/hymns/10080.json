Agni impels a single man to battle, and with him rends in pieces many a foeman.\np:Agni rejoiced the car of him who praised lim, and from the waters burnt away jarutha. Agni saved Atri in the fiery cavem, and made Nrmedha rich with troops of children.\np:Agni hath granted wealth that decks the hero, and sent the sage who wins a thousand cattle. Agni hath made oblations rise to Heaven: to every place are Agni's laws extended.\np:With songs of praise the Ṛṣis call on Agni; on Agni, heroes worsted in the foray. Birds flying in the region call on Agni around a thousand cattle Agni wanders.\np:Races of human birth pay Agni worship, men who have sprung from Nahus' line adore him. Stablished in holy oil is Agni's pasture, on the Gandharva path of Law and Order.\np:The Ṛbhus fabricated prayer for Agni, and we with mighty hymns have called on Agni. Agni, most Youthful Deva, protect the singer: win us by worship, Agni, great possessions.",
