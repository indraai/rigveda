He with the sharpened horns brings forth abundance: the Silvery shines by night, by day the Golden.\np:Strong Indu, bathed in milk, flows on for Indra, Soma exciting strength, to make him joyful. He quells malignities and subdues the demons, the King of mighty power who brings us comfort.\np:Then in a stream he flows, milked out with press-stones, mingled with sweetness, through the fleecy filter- Indu rejoicing in the love of Indra who gladdens, for the Deva's enjoyment.\np:As he is purified he pours out treasures, a God bedewing Devas with his own juices.
