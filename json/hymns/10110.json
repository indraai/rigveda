Convey our offering to Heaven, exalting with holy thoughts ourhymns of praise and worship.\np:Invoked, deserving prayer and adoration, O Agni, come accordant with the Devas. Thou art, O Youthful Lords&#146; Invoker, so, best of Creators, bring them quickly.\np:By rule the Sacred Grass is scattered eastward, a robe to clothe this Earth when dawns are breaking. Widely it spreads around and far-extended, fair for the Devas and bringing peace and freedom.\np:Let the expansive Doors be widely opened, like wives who deck their beauty for their husbands. Lofty, celestial, all-impelling Portals, admit the Devas and give them easy entrance.\np:Pouring sweet dews let holy Night and Morning, each close to each, he seated at their station, Lofty, celestial Dames with gold to deck them. assuming all their fair and radiant beauty.\np:Come the two first celestial sweet-voiced Hotars, arranging offering for man to worship As singers who inspire us in assemblies, showing the eastward light with their direction.\np:Let Bh&#257;rat&#299; come quickly to our worship, and I&#7735;&#257; showing like a human being.
