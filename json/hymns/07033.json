Indra preferred Vasisthas to the Soma pressed by the son of Vayata, Pasadyumna.\np:So, verily, with these he crossed the river, in company with these he slaughtered Bheda. So in the fight with the Ten Kings, Vasisthas! did Indra help Sud&#257;s through your devotions.\np:I gladly, men I with prayer prayed by our fathers have fixed your axle: ye shall not be injured: Since, when ye sang aloud the Sakvari verses, Vasisthas! ye invigorated Indra.\np:Like thirsty men they looked to Heaven, in battle with the Ten Kings, surrounded and imploring. Then Indra heard Vasi&#7779;&#7789;ha as he praised him, and gave the Trtsus ample room and freedom.\np:Like sticks and staves wherewith they drive the cattle, Stripped bare, the Bharatas were found defenceless: Vasi&#7779;&#7789;ha then became their chief and leader: then widely. were the Trtsus' clans extended.\np:Three fertilize the worlds with genial moisture: three noble Creatures cast a light before them. Three that give warmth to all attend the morning.

Your laud, Vasisthas, can never be attained by any other.\np:They with perceptions of the heart in secret resort to that which spreads a thousand branches. The Apsaras brought hither the Vasisthas wearing the vesture spun for them by Yama.\np:A form of lustre springing from the lightning wast thou, when Varu&#7751;a and Mitra saw thee.
