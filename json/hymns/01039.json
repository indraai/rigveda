Heroes, your course is through the forest trees of Earth, and through the fissures of the rocks.\np:Consumers of your foes, no enemy of yours is found in Heaven or on the Earth: Ye Somas. May the strength, held in this bond, be yours, to bid defiance even now.\np:They make the mountains rock and reel, they rend the forest-kings apart. Onward, ye Devas, drive, like creatures drunk with wine, ye, Devas with all your company.\np:Ye to your chariot have yoked the spotted deer: a red deer, as a leader, draws. Even the Earth herself listened as ye came near, and men were sorely terrified.\np:O Somas, quickly we desire your succour for this work of ours. Come to us with your aid as in the days of old, so now for frightened Ka&#7751;va's sake.\np:Should any monstrous foe, O Devas, sent by you or sent by mortals threaten us, Tear ye him from us with your power and with your might, and with the succours that are yours.\np:For ye, the worshipful and wise, have guarded Ka&#7751;va perfectly. O Devas, come to us with full protecting help, as lightning flashes seek the rain.\np:Whole strength have ye, O Bounteous Ones; perfect, Earth-shakers, is your might. Devas, against the poet's wrathful enemy send ye an enemy like a dart.",
