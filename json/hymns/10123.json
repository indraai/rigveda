Ascending to the lofty height of Order, the bands of singers 'sip the sweets of Amṛta.\np:Knowing his form, the sages yearned to meet him: they have come nigh to hear the wild Bull's bellow. Performing offering they reached the river: for the Gandharva found the immortal waters.\np:The Apsaras, the Lady, sweetly smiling, supports her Lover in sublimest Heaven. In his Friend's dwelling as a friend he wanders: he, Vena, rests him on his golden pinion.\np:They gaze on thee with longing in their spirit, as on a strong-winged bird that mounteth sky-ward; On thee with wings of gold, Indra's envoy, the Bird that hasteneth to the home of Yama.\np:Erect, to Heaven hath the Gandharva mounted, pointing at us his many-coloured weapons; Clad in sweet raiment beautiful to look on, for he, as light, produceth forms that please us.\np:When as a spark he cometh near the ocean, still looking with a vulture's eye to Heaven, His lustre, joying in its own bright splendour, maketh dear glories in the lowest region.",
