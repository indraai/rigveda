Bearing our meditations, the sky's ridge have they mounted, and in a moment speed round Earth and Heaven.\np:This is the Godhead, this might of S&#363;rya: he hath withdrawn what spread o&#146;er work unfinished. When he hath loosed his Horses from their station, straight over all Night spreadeth out her garment.\np:In the sky's lap the Sun this form assumeth that Varu&#7751;a and Mitr. May behold it. His Bay Steeds well maintain his power eternal, at one time bright and darksome at another.\np:This day, O Devas, while S&#363;rya is ascending, deliver us from trouble and dishonour. This prayer of our. May Varu&#7751;a grant, and Mitra, and Aditi and Sindhu, Earth and Heaven.",
