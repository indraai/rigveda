    "feecting": "p:VĀYU, let fleet-foot coursers bring thee speedily to this our feast, to drink first of the juice we pour, to the first draught of Soma juice.\np: May our glad hymn, discerning well, uplifted, gratify thy mind. Come with thy team-drawn car, O Soma, to the gift, come to the gift.\r\np:May the joy-giving drops, O Soma gladden thee, effectual, well prepared, directed to the heavens, strong, blent with milk and seeking Heaven; That aids, effectual to fulfil. May wait upon our skilful power. Associate teams come hitherward to grant our meditations: they shall address the hymns we sing.\np:Two red steeds Soma yokes, Soma two purple steeds, swift-footed, to the chariot, to the pole to draw, most able, at the pole, to draw. Wake up intelligence, as when a lover wakes his sleeping love. Illumine Heaven and Earth, make thou the Dawns to shine, for glory make the Dawns to shine.\np:For thee the radiant Dawns in the far-distant sky broaden their lovely garments forth in wondrous beams, bright-coloured in their new-born beams. For thee the nectar-yielding Cow pours all rich treasures forth as milk. The Marut host hast thou engendered from the womb, the Devas from the womb of Heaven.\np:For thee the pure bright quickly-flowing Soma-drops, strong in their heightening power, hasten to mix themselves, hasten to the water to be mixed. To thee the weary coward prays for luck that h. May speed away. Thou by thy law protectest us from every world, yea, from the world of highest Devas.\np:Thou, Soma, who hast none before thee, first of all hast right to drink these offerings of Soma juice, hast right to drink the juice out-poured, Yea, poured by all invoking tribes who free themselves from taint of sin, for thee all cows are milked to yield the Soma-milk, to yield the butter and the milk.",
