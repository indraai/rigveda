Their high imperial migh. May nowhere be assailed, ne’e. May their Godhead be assailed.\r\np:For the broad Sun was seen a path more widely laid, the path of holy law hath been maintained with rays, the eye with Bhaga's rays of light. Firm-set in Heaven is Mitra's home, and Aryaman's and Indra's. Thence they give forth great vital strength which merits praise, high power of life that men shall praise.\np:With Aditi the luminous, the celestial, upholder of the people, come ye day by day, ye who watch sleepless, day by day. Resplendent might have ye obtained Devas Lords of liberal gifts. Movers of men, mild both, are Mitra, Indra, mover of men is Aryaman.\np:This Soma be most sweet to Mitra, Indra: he in the drinking-feasts, shall have a share thereof, sharing, a Deva, among the Devas. May all the Devas of one accord accept it joyfully to-day. Therefore do ye, O Kings, accomplish what we ask, ye Righteous Ones, whate’er we ask.\np:Whoso, with worship serves Mitra and Indra, him guard ye carefully, uninjured, from distress, guard from distress the liberal man. Aryaman guards him well who acts uprightly following his law, who beautifies their service with his lauds, who makes it beautiful with songs of praise.\np:Worship will I profess to lofty Devas, to Heaven and Earth, to Mitra and to bounteous Indra, the Bounteous, the Compassionate. Praise Indra, praise thou Agni, praise Bhaga and heavenly Aryaman. Lon. May we live and have attendant progeny, have progeny with Soma's help.\np:With the Devas’ help, with Indra still beside us. May we be held self-splendid with the Devas. May Agni, Indra give us shelter thi. May we gain, we and our wealthy princes.",
