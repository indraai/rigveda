Indra comes from the far distance, and chases from us all distress and sorrow.\np:His chariot decked with pearl, of various colours, lofty, with golden pole hath mounted, the many-rayed One, Indra the holy, bound, bearing power and might, for darksome regions.\np:Drawing the gold-yoked car his Bays, white-footed, have manifested light to all the peoples. Held in the lap of Indra, divine One, all men, all beings have their place forever.\np:Three heavens there are; two Indra's, adjacent: in Yama's world is one, the home of heroes, as on a linch-pin, firm, rest things immortal: he who hath known it let him here declare it.\np:He, strong of wing, hath lightened up the regions, deep-quivering Devas, the gentle Leader. Where now is Sūrya, where is one to tell us to what celestial sphere his ray hath wandered?\np:The Earth's eight points his brightness hath illumined, three desert regions and the Seven Rivers. Deva Indra the gold-eyed hath come hither, giving choice treasures unto him who worships.\np:The golden-handed Indra, far-seeing, goes on his way between the Earth and Heaven, Drives away sickness, bids the Sun approach us, and spreads the bright sky through the darksome region.\np:May he, gold-handed Indra, kind Leader, come hither to us with his help and favour. Driving off Rākṣasas and Yātudhānas is present, praised in hymns at evening.\np:O Indra, thine ancient dustless pathways are well established in the air's mid-region: O Deva, come by those paths so fair to travel, preserve thou us from harm this day, and bless us.",
