    "feecting": "p:AGNI I hold as herald, the munificent, the gracious, Son of Strength, who knoweth all that live, as holy Singer, knowing all, Lord of fair rites, a God with form erected turning to the Devas. He, when the flame hath sprung forth from the holy oil, the offered fatness, longeth for it with his glow.\np:We, sacrificing, call on thee best worshipper, the eldest of A&#7749;girases, Singer, with hymns, thee, brilliant One! with singers&#146; hymns; Thee, wandering round as &#146;t were the sky, who art the invoking Monk of men, whom, Bull with hair of flame the people must observe, the people that he speed them on.\np:He with his shining glory blazing far and wide, he verily it is who slayeth demon foes, slayeth the demons like an axe: At whose close touch things solid shake, and what is stable yields like trees.\np: Subduing all, he keeps his ground and flinches not, from the skilled archer flinches not.\r\np:To him, as one who knows, even things solid yield: unrough fire-sticks heated hot he gives his gifts to aid. Men offer Agni gifts for aid. He deeply piercing many a thing hews it like wood with fervent glow. Even hard and solid food he crunches with his might, yea, hard and solid food with might.\np:Here near we place the sacred food for him who shines forth fairer in the night than in the day, with life then stronger than by day. His life gives sure and firm defence as that one giveth to a son. The during fires enjoy things given and things not given, the during fires enjoy as food.\np:He, roaring very loudly like the Devas&#146; host, in fertile cultivated fields adorable, in desert spots adorable, accepts and eats our offered gifts, ensign of offering by desert; So let all, joying, love his path when he is glad, as men pursue a path for bliss.\np:Even as they who sang forth hymns, addressed to Heaven, the Bh&#7771;gus with their prayer and praise invited him, the Bh&#7771;gus rubbing, offering gifts. For radiant Agni, Lord of all these treasures, is exceeding strong. May he, the wise, accept the grateful coverings, the wise accept the coverings.\np:Thee we invoke, the Lord of all our settled homes, common to all, the household's guardian, to enjoy, bearer of true hymns, to enjoy. Thee we invoke, the guest of men, by whose mouth, even as a sire's, All these Immortals come to gain their food of life, oblations come to Devas as food.\np:Thou, Agni, most victorious with thy conquering strength, most Mighty One, art born for service of the Devas, like wealth for service of the Devas. Most mighty is thine ecstasy, most splendid is thy mental power. Therefore men wait upon thee, undecaying One, like vassals, undecaying One.\np:To him the mighty, conquering with victorious strength, to Agni walking with the dawn, who sendeth kine, be sung your laud, to Agni sung; As he who with oblation comes calls him aloud in every place. Before the brands of fire he shouteth singerlike, the herald, kindler of the brands.\np:Agni, beheld by us in nearest neighbourhood, accordant with the Devas, bring us, with gracious love, great riches with thy gracious love. Give us O Mightiest, what is great, to see and to enjoy the Earth. As one of awful power, stir up heroic might for those who praise thee, Bounteous Lord!",
