So quickly, mid the Devas, ye gained immortal life. V&#257;jas and &#7770;bhus, your great work must be extolled.\np:Wealth from the &#7770;bhus is most glorious in renown, that which the Heroes, famed for vigour, have produced. In synods must be sung the car which Vibhvan wrought: that which ye favour, Devas! is famed among mankind.\np:Strong is the steed, the man a sage in eloquence, the bowman is a hero hard to beat in fight, Great store of wealth and manly power hath he obtained whom V&#257;ja, Vibhvan, &#7770;bhus have looked kindly on.\np:To you hath been assigned the fairest ornament, the hymn of praise: V&#257;jas and &#7770;bhus, joy therein; For ye have lore and wisdom and poetic skill: as such, with this our meditation we call on you to come.\np:According to the wishes of our heart. May ye, who have full knowledge of all the delights of men, Fashion for us, O &#7770;bhus, power and splendid wealth, rich in high courage, excellent, and vital strength.\np:Bestowing on us here riches and offspring, here fashion fame for us befitting heroes.
