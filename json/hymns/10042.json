Singer, make Indra rest beside the Soma.\r\np:Draw thy Friend to thee like a cow at milking: O Singer, wake up Indra as a lover. Make thou the Hero haste to give us riches even as a vessel filled brimful with treasure.\np:Why, Indra, do they call thee Bounteous; Giver? Quicken me: thou, I hear, art he who quickens. &#346;akra, let my intelligence be active, and bring us luck that finds great wealth, O Indra.\np:Standing, in battle for their rights, together, the people, Indra, in the fray invoke thee. Him who brings gifts the Hero makes his comrade: with him who pours no juice he seeks not friendship.\np:Whoso with plenteous food for him expresses strong Somas as much quickly-coming treasure, for him he overthrows in early morning his swift well-weaponed foes, and subdues the tyrant.\np:He unto whom we offer praises, Indra, Indra, who hath joined to ours his wishes,&#151; Before him even afar the foe must tremble: low before him must bow all human glories.\np:With thy fierce bolt, O God invoked of many, drive to a distance from afar the foeman. O Indra, give us wealth in corn and cattle, and make thy singer's prayer gain strength and riches.\np:Indra, the swallower of strong libations rich in the boons they bring, the potent Somas. He, Indra, will not restrict his bounty he brings much wealth unto we.\np:Yea, by superior play he wins advantage, when he, a gambler, piles his gains in season. Celestial-natured, he o&#146;erwhelms with riches the devotee who keeps not back his treasure.\np:O Much-invoked. May we subdue all famine and evil want with store of grain and cattle. May we allied, as first in rank, with princes obtain possessions by our own exertion.\np:B&#7771;haspati protect us from the rearward, and from above, and from below, from sinners!
