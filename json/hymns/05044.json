By skill he wins the boon whereon his heart is set: he who bestirs himself shall bring the thing to pass.\np:The chief and best of these abideth in the sea, nor doth libation fail wherein it is prolonged. The heart of him who praiseth trembleth not in fear there where the hymn is found connected with the pure.\np:For it is he: with though to of Ksatra, Manasa, of Yajata, and Sadhri, and Evavada, with Avatsara's sweet songs will we strive to win the mightiest strength which even he who knows should gain.\np:The Hawk is their full source, girth-stretching rapturous drink of Visvavara, of Mayin, and Yajata. They ever seek a fresh draught so that the, may come, know when thy time to halt and drink thy fill is near.\np:Sadaprna the holy, Tarya, Srutavit, and Bahuvrkta, joined with you, have slain the foes.
