The Father's genial flow bedews the Mother; therewith the Sire, therewith the son is nourished.\np:In him all living creatures have their being, and the three heavens with triply-flowing waters. Three reservoirs that sprinkle down their treasure shed their sweet streams around him with a murmur.\np:May this my song to Sovran Lord Parjanya come near unto his heart and give him pleasure. May we obtain the showers that bring enjoyment, and God-protected plants with goodly fruitage.\np:He is the Bull of all, and their impregner: he holds the life of all things fixed and moving.
