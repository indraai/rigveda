All that existed then was void and form less: by the great power of Warmth was born that Unit.\np:Thereafter rose Desire in the beginning, Desire, the primal seed and germ of Spirit. Sages who searched with their heart's thought discovered the existent's kinship in the non-existent.\np:Transversely was their severing line extended: what was above it then, and what below it?
