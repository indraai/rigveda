B&#7771;haspati, seeking light amid the darkness, drave forth the bright cows: three he made apparent.\np:When he had cleft the lairs and western castle, he cut off three from him who held the waters. B&#7771;haspati discovered, while he thundered like Devas, the dawn, the Sun, the cow, the lightning.\np:As with a hand, so with his roaring Indra cleft Vala through, the guardian of the cattle. Seeking the milk-draught with sweatshining comrades he stole the Pa&#7751;i's kine and left him weeping.\np:He with bright faithful Friends, winners of booty, hath rent the milker of the cows asunder. B&#7771;haspati with wild boars strong and mighty, sweating with heat, hath gained a rich possession.\np:They, longing for the kine, with faithful spirit incited with their hymns the Lord of cattle. B&#7771;haspati freed the radiant cows with comrades self-yoked, averting shame from one another.\np:In our assembly with auspicious praises exalting him who roareth like a lion, Maywe, in every fight where heroes conquer, rejoice in strong B&#7771;haspati the Victor.\np:When he had won him every sort of booty and gone to Heaven and its most lofty mansions, Men praised B&#7771;haspati the Mighty, bringing the light within their mouths from sundry places.\np:Fulfil the prayer that begs for vital vigour: aid in your wonted manner even the humble. Let all our foes be turned and driven backward. Hear this, O Heaven and Earth, ye All-producers.\np:Indra with mighty strength cleft asunder the head of Arbuda the watery monster, Slain Ahi, and set free the Seven Rivers.
