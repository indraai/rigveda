That efficacious power that comes from lofty Heaven, ye bind unto the work, as to the pole an ox.\np:On this great Earth ye send your treasure down with might: unstained by dust, the crowding kine are in the stalls. Here in the neighbourhood they cry unto the Sun at morning and at evening, like swift birds of prey.\np:The flames with curling tresses serve your offering, whereto ye sing the song, Mitra and Indra. Send down of your free will, prosper our holy songs: ye are sole Masters of the singer's hymn of praise.\np:Whoso with offers toiling brings you gifts, and worships, sage and priest, fulfilling your desire. To him do ye draw nigh and taste his offerings. Come well-inclined to us unto our songs and prayer.\np:With offers and with milk they deck you first, ye Righteous Ones, as if through stirrings of the mind. To you they bring their hymns with their collected thought, while ye with earnest soul come to us gloriously.\np:Rich strength of life is yours: ye. Heroes, have obtained through your surpassing powers rich far-extending might. Not the past days conjoined with nights, not rivers, not the Paṇis have attained your Godhead and your wealth.",
