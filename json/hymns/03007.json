To thee safe resting in the seat of Order the Cow alone upon her way proceedeth.\np:Wise Master, wealthy finder-out of riches, he mounted those wh. May with case be guided. He, dark-backed, manifold with varied aspect, hath made them burst forth from their food the brush-wood.\np:Strength-giving streams bear hither him eternal, fain to support the mighty work. of Tva&#7779;&#7789;ar.
