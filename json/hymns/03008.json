Driving far from us poverty and famine, lift thyself up to bring us great good fortune.\np:Lord of the Forest, raise. thyself up on the loftiest spot of Earth. Give splendour, fixt and measured well, to him who brings the offering.\np:Well-robed, enveloped he is come, the youthful: springing to life his glory waxeth greater. Contemplative in mind and God-adoring, sages of high intelligence upraise him.\np:Sprung up he rises in the days' fair weather, increasing in the men-frequented synod. With song the wise and skilful consecrate him: his voice the Deva-adoring singer utters.\np:, Ye whom religious men have firmly planted; thou Forest Sovran whom the axe hath fashioned. Let those the Stakes divine which here are standing be fain to grant us wealth with store of children.\np:O men who lift the ladles up, these hewn and planted in the ground, Bringing a blessing to the field, shall bear our precious gift to Devas.\np:Ä€dityas, Somas, Devas, careful leaders, Earth.
