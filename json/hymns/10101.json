Prepare the implements, make all things ready, and let the offering, my friends, go forward.\np:Lay on the yokes, and fasten well the traces: formed is the furrow, sow the seed within it. Through son. May we find bearing fraught with plenty: near to the ripened grain approach the sickle.\np:Wise, through desire of bliss from Devas, the skilful bind the traces fast, and lay the yokes on either side.\np:Arrange the buckets in their place securely fasten on the straps. We will pour forth the well that hath a copious stream, fair-flowing well that never fails.\np:I pour the water from the well with pails prepared and goodly straps, Unfailing, full, with plenteous stream.\np:Refresh the horses, win the prize before you: equip a chariot fraught with happy fortune.
