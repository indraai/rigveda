May see them when these hymns are chanted in a future age.\np:These Soma produced with blast and smelting, like a Smith, Existence, in an earlier age of Devas, from Non-existence sprang.\np:Existence, in the earliest age of Devas, from Non-existence sprang.\np: Thereafter were the regions born. This sprang from the Productive Power.\r\np:Earth sprang from the Productive Power the regions from the Earth were born. Dakṣa was born of Aditi, and Aditi was Dakṣa's Child.\np:For Aditi, O Dakṣa, she who is thy Daughter, was brought forth. After her were the blessed Devas born sharers of immortal life.\np:When ye, O Devas, in yonder deep closeclasping one another stood, thence, as of dancers, from your feet a thickening cloud of dust arose.\np:When, O ye Devas, like Yatis, ye caused all existing things to grow, then ye brought Sūrya forward who was lying hidden in the sea.\np:Eight are the Sons of Adid who from her body sprang to life. With seven she went to meet the Devas she cast Martanda far away.\np:So with her Seven Sons Aditi went forth to meet the earlier age. She brought Martanda thitherward to spring to life and die again.",
