But to another hath she shown her beauty as a fond well-dressed woman to her husband.\np:One man they call a laggard, dull in friendship: they never urge him on to deeds of valour. He wanders on in profitless illusion: the Voice he heard yields neither fruit,nor blossom.\np:No part in V&#257;k hath he who hath abandoned his own dear friend who knows the truth of friendship. Even if he hears her still in vain he listens: naught knows he of the path of righteous action.\np:Unequal in the quickness of their spirit are friends endowed alike with eyes and hearing. Some look like tanks that reach the mouth or shoulder, others like pools of water fit to bathe in.\np:When friendly Brahmans offering together with mental impulse which the heart hath fashioned, they leave one far behind through their attainments, and some who count as Brahmans wander elsewhere.\np:Those men who step not back and move not forward, nor Brahmans nor preparers of libations, Having attained to V&#257;k in sinful fashion spin out their thread in ignorance like spinsters.\np:All friends are joyful in the friend who cometh in triumph, having conquered in assembly. He is their blame-averter, food-provider prepared is he and fit for deed of vigour.\np:One plies his constant task reciting verses. one sings the holy psalm in Sakvari measures. One more, the Brahman, tells the lore of being, and one lays down the rules of sacrificing.",
