Bringing oblations evermore we call to thee.<br> 9 Even as a herdsman I have brought thee hymns of praise: O Father of the Maruts, give us happiness,<br> Blessed is thy most favouring benevolence, so, verily, do we desire thy saving help.<br> 10 Far be thy dart that killeth men or cattle: thy bliss be with us, O thou Lord of Heroes.<br> Be gracious unto us, O God, and bless us, and then vouchsafe us doubly-strong protection.<br> 11 We, seeking help, have spoken and adored him: may Rudra, girt by Maruts, hear our calling.<br> This prayer of ours may Varu&#7751;a grant, and Mitra, and Aditi and Sindhu, Earth and Heaven.</p>  \n<p><HR>\n<CENTER>\n<A HREF=\"rv01115.htm\">Next: HYMN CXV.
