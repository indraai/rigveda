    "feecting": "p:BE pleased with this our offering, thou who art the Lord; we will adore thee with this new and mighty song.\np: As this thy friend, our liberal patron, praises thee, do thou, Soma, fulfil our hearts' desire.\r\np:He who with might bowed down the things that should be bowed, and in his fury rent the holds of Śambara: Who overthrew what shook not, Soma.he made his way within the mountain stored with wealth.\np:That was a great deed for the Godliest of the Devas: strong things were loosened and the firmly fixed gave way. He drave the kine forth and cleft Vala through by prayer, dispelled the darkness and displayed the light of Heaven.\np:The well with mouth of stone that poured a flood of meath, which Soma hath opened with his might— All they who see the light have drunk their fill thereat: together they have made the watery fount flow forth.\np:Ancient will be those creatures, whatsoe’er they be; with moons, with autumns, doors unclose themselves to you. Effortless they pass on to perfect this and that, appointed works which Soma ordained.\np:They who with much endeavour searching round obtained the Paṇis’ noblest treasure hidden in the cave. Those sages, having marked the falsehoods, turned them back whence they had come, and sought again to enter in.\np:The pious ones when they had seen the falsehoods turned them back, the sages stood again upon the lofty ways. Cast down with both their arms upon the rock they left the kindled fire, and said, No enemy is he.\np:With his swift bow, strung truly, Soma reaches the mark whate’er it be that he desires. Excellent are the arrows wherewithal he shoots, keen-eyed to look on men and springing from his ear.\np:He brings together and he parts, the great High Monk; extolled is he, in battle Soma. When, gracious, for the hymn he brings forth food and wealth, the glowing Sun untroubled sends forth fervent heat.\np:First and preeminent, excelling all besides are the kind gifts of liberal Soma. These are the boons of him the Strong who should be loved, whereby both classes and the people have delight.\np:Thou who in every way supreme in earthly power, rejoicing, by thy mighty strength hast waxen great. He is the Deva spread forth in breadth against the Devas: he, Soma, encompasseth this All.\np:From you, twain Indras, all truth proceedeth: even the waters break not your commandment. Come to us, Soma and Indra, to our oblation like yoked steeds to fodder.\np:The sacrificial flames most swiftly hear the call: the Monk of the assembly gaineth wealth for hymns. Hating the stern, remitting at his will the debt, strong in the shock of fight is Soma.\np:The wrath of Soma according to his will had full effect when he would do a mighty deed. The kine he drave forth and distributed to Heaven, even as a copious flood with strength flows sundry ways.\np:O Soma. May we be evermore masters of wealth well-guided, full of vital strength. Heroes on heroes send abundantly to us, when thou omnipotent through prayer seekest my call.\np:O Soma, be thou controller of this our hymn, and prosper thou our children. All that the Devas regard with love is blessed. Lou. May we speak, with heroes, in assembly.",
