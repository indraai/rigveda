    "feecting": "p:THE drops of Soma juice like cows who yield their milk have flowed forth, rich in meath, unto the Shining One, and, seated on the grass, raising their voice, assumed the milk, the covering robe wherewith the udders stream.\np:He bellows with a roar arourd the highest twigs: the Tawny One is sweetened as he breaks them up.\np: Then passing through the sieve into the ample room throws off the dregs according to his wish.\r\np:The gladdening drink that measured out the meeting Twins fills full with milk the Eternal Ever-waxing Pair. Bringing to light the Two great Regions limitless, moving above them he gained sheen that never fades.\np:Wandering through, the Parents, strengthening the floods, the Sage makes his place swell with his own native might. The stalk is mixed with grain: he comes led by the men together with the sisters, and preserves the Head.\np:With energetic intellect the Sage is born, deposited as germ of Law, far from the Twins. They being young at first showed visibly distinct the Creature that is half-concealed and half-exposed.\np:The sages knew the form of him the Gladdener, what time the Falcon brought the plant from far away. Him who assures success they beautified in streams, the stalk who yearned therefor, mighty and meet for praise.\np:Together with the &#7770;&#7779;is, with their prayers and hymns ten women deck thee, Soma, friendly when effused. Led by the men, with invocations of the Devas, through the fleece, thou hast given us strength to win the spoil.\np:Songs resonant with praise have celebrated him. Soma, Friend, springing forth with his fair company. Even him who rich in meath, with undulating stream, Winnner of Wealth, Immortal, sends his voice from Heaven,\np:He sends it into all the region forth from Heaven. Soma, while he is filtcred, settles in the jars. With milk and waters is he decked when pressed with stones: Indu, when purified, shall find sweet rest and room.\np:Even thus poured forth How on thy way, O Soma, vouchsafing us most manifold lively vigour. We will invoke benevolent Earth and Heaven. Give us, ye Devas, riches with noble heroes.",
