I VALUE Agni that good Lord, the home to which the kine return:<br> Whom fleet-foot coursers seek as home, and strong enduring steeds as home. Bring food to those who sing thy praise.<br> 2 &#146;Tis Agni whom we laud as good, to whom the milch-kine come in herds,<br> To whom the chargers swift of foot, to whom our well-born princes come. Bring food to those who sing thy praise.<br> 3 Agni the God of all mankind, gives, verily, a steed to man.<br> Agni gives precious gear for wealth, treasure he gives when he is pleased. Bring food to those who sing thy praise.<br> 4 God, Agni, we will kindle thee, rich in thy splendour, fading not,<br> So that this glorious fuel may send forth by day its light for thee. Bring food to those who sing thy praise.<br> 5 To thee the splendid, Lord of flame, bright, wondrous, Prince of men, is brought.<br> Oblation with the holy verse, O Agni, bearer of our gifts.<br> Bring food to those who sing thy praise.<br> 6 These Agnis in the seats of the fire nourish each thing most excellent.<br> They give delight, they spread abroad, they move themselves continually. Bring food to those who sing thy praise.<br> 7 Agni, these brilliant flames of thine wax like strong chargers mightily,<br> Who with the treadings of their hoofs go swiftly to the stalls of kine. Bring food to those who sing thy praise.<br> 8 To us who laud thee, Agni, bring fresh food and safe and happy homes.<br> May we who have sung hymns to thee have thee for envoy in each house. Bring food to those who sing thy praise.<br> 9 Thou, brilliant God, within thy mouth warmest both ladles of the oil.<br> So fill us also, in our hymns, abundantly, O Lord of Strength. Bring food to those who sing thy praise.<br> 10 Thus Agni have we duly served with sacrifices and with hymns.<br> So may he give us what we crave, store of brave sons and fleet-foot steeds. Bring food to those who sing thy praise.</p>  \n<p><HR>\n<CENTER>\n<A HREF=\"rv05007.htm\">Next: HYMN VII. Agni.</A></CENTER>\n</BODY>\n</HTML>\n",
