Let those who often bring their solemn rites conquer the noisy babblers who present no gifts.\np:More beautiful than beauty must this seem to me, when the son duly careth for his parents' line. The wife attracts the husband: with a shout of joy the man's auspicious marriage is performed aright.\np:This beauteous place of meeting have I looked upon, where, like milch-cows, the kine order the marriage train; Where the Herd's Mother counts as first and best of all, and round her are the seven-toned people of the choir.\np:The Pious One hath reached your place before the rest: One only moves victorious with the Somas' band. To these your helpers pour our meath, Immortal Devas, with whom your song of praise hath power to win their gifts.\np:He who maintains the Laws of Deva informed me that thou wast lying hidden in the waters. Indra, who knoweth well, beheld and showed thee. By him instructed am I come, O Agni.\np:The stranger asks the way of him who knows it: taught by the skilful guide he travels onward.
