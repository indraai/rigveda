His dear Ones, following his Law, have prospered the Three Dawns for him.\np:He, visible o’er all the Earth, stablished the quarters of the sky: He measured out the eastern place, that is the fold of Indra: like a strong herdsman is the Deva.\np:He who supports the worlds of life, he who well knows the hidden names mysterious of the morning beams, He cherishes much wisdom, Sage, as Heaven brings forth each varied form.\np:In whom all wisdom centres, as the nave is set within the wheel. Haste ye to honour Trita, as kine haste to gather in the fold, even as they muster steeds to yoke.\np:He wraps these regions as a robe; he contemplates the tribes of Devas and all the works of mortal men. Before the home of Indra all the Devas follow his decree.\np:He is an Ocean far-removed, yet through the Heaven to him ascends the worship which these realms possess. With his bright foot he overthrew their magic, and went up to Heaven.\np:Ruler, whose bright far-seeing rays, pervading all three earths, have filled the three superior realms of Heaven. Firm is the seat of Indra: over the Seven he rules as King.\np:Who, after his decree, o’erspread the Dark Ones with a robe of light; Who measured out the ancient seat, who pillared both the worlds apart as the Unborn supported Heaven.
