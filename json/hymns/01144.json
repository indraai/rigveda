He, when he dwelt extended in the waters’ lap, absorbed those Godlike powers for which he is adored.\np:Seeking in course altern to reach the selfsame end the two copartners strive to win this beauteous form. Like Bhaga must he be duly invoked by us, as he who drives the car holds fast the horse's reins.\np:He whom the two copartners with observance tend, the pair who dwell together in the same abode, by night as in the day the grey one was born young, passing untouched by eld through many an age of man.\np:Him the ten fingers, the devotions, animate: we mortals call on him a God to give us help. He speeds over the sloping surface of the land: new deeds hath he performed with those who gird him round.\np:For, Agni, like a herdsman, thou by thine own might rulest o’er all that is in Heaven and on the Earth; And these two Mighty Ones, bright, golden closely joined, rolling them round are come unto thy sacred grass.\np:Agni, accept with joy, be glad in this our meditation, joy-giver, self-sustained, strong, born of Holy Law! For fair to see art thou turning to every side, pleasant to look on as a dwelling filled with food.",
