<h1>HYMN LXXIV. Agni.</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn">
<p>As forth to sacrifice we go, a hymn to a hymn let us say, Who hears us even when afar;</p><p>Who, from of old, in carnage, when the people gathered, hath preserved His household for the worshipper.</p><p>And let men say, Agni is born, e&#146;en he who slayeth V&#7771;tra, he Who winneth wealth in every fight.</p><p>Him in whose house an envoy thou lovest to taste his offered gifts, and strengthenest his sacrifice,</p><p>Him, A&#7749;giras, thou Son of Strength, all men call happy in his God, His offerings, and his sacred grass.</p><p>Hitherward shalt thou bring these Gods to our laudation and to taste. These offered gifts, fair-shining One.</p><p>When, Agni, on thine embassage thou goest not a sound is heard of steed or straining of thy car.</p><p>Aided by thee uninjured, strong, one after other, goes he forth: Agni, the offerer forward steps.</p><p>And splendid strength, heroic, high, Agni, thou grantest from the Gods, Thou God, to him who offers gifts.  </p>
