<h1>HYMN LVII. Indra.</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn">
<p>To him most liberal, lofty Lord of lofty wealth, verily powerful and strong, I bring my hymn,&#151; Whose checkless bounty, as of waters down a slope, is spread abroad for all that live, to give them strength.</p><p>Now all this world, for worship, shall come after thee&#151;the offerer's libations like floods to the depth, when the well-loved one seems to rest upon the hill, the thunderbolt of Indra, shatterer wrought of gold.</p><p>To him the terrible, most meet for lofty praise, like bright Dawn, now bring gifts with reverence in this rite, whose being, for renown, yea, Indra-power and light, have been created, like bay steeds, to move with speed.</p><p>Thine, Indra, praised by many, excellently rich! are we who trusting in thy help draw near to thee. Lover of praise, none else but thou receives our laud: as earth loves all her creatures, love thou this our hymn.</p><p>Great is thy power, O Indra, we are thine. Fulfil, O Maghavan, the wish of this thy worshipper. After thee lofty heaven hath measured out its strength: to thee and to thy power this earth hath bowed itself.</p><p>Thou, who hast thunder for thy weapon, with thy bolt hast shattered into pieces this broad massive cloud. Thou hast sent down the obstructed floods that they may flow: thou hast, thine own for ever, all victorious might.  </p>
