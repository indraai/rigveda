<h1>HYMN LIII. Indra.</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn">
<p>WE will present fair praise unto the Mighty One, our hymns to Indra in Vivasv&#257;n's dwelling-place; For he hath ne&#146;er found wealth in those who seem to sleep: those who give wealth to men accept no paltry praise.</p><p>Giver of horses, Indra, giver, thou, of kine, giver of barley, thou art Lord and guard of wealth: Man's helper from of old, not disappointing hope, Friend of our friends, to thee as such we sing this praise.</p><p>Indra, most splendid, powerful, rich in mighty deeds, this treasure spread around is known to be thine own. Gather therefrom, O Conqueror, and bring to us: fail not the hope of him who loves and sings to thee.</p><p>Well pleased with these bright flames and with these Soma drops, take thou away our poverty with seeds and kine. With Indra scattering the Dasyu through these drops, freed from their hate may we obtain abundant food.</p><p>Let us obtain, O Indra, plenteous wealth and food, with strength exceeding glorious, shining to the sky: May we obtain the Goddess Providence, the strength of heroes, special source of cattle, rich in steeds.</p><p>These our libations strength-inspiring, Soma draughts, gladdened thee in the fight with V&#7771;tra, Hero Lord, What time thou slewest for the singer with trimmed grass ten thousand V&#7771;tras, thou resistless in thy might.</p><p>Thou goest on from fight to fight intrepidly, destroying castle after castle here with strength. Thou, Indra, with thy friend who makes the foe bow down, slewest from far away the guileful Namuci.</p><p>Thou hast struck down in death Kara&ntilde;ja, Par&#7751;aya, in Atithigva's very glorious going forth. Unyielding, when &#7770;ji&#347;van compassed them with siege, thou hast conquered the hundred forts of Va&#7749;g&#7771;ida.</p><p>With all-outstripping chariot-wheel, O Indra, thou far-famed, hast overthrown the twice ten Kings of men, with sixty thousand nine-and-ninety followers, who came in arms to fight with friendless Su&#347;ravas.</p><p>Thou hast protected Su&#347;ravas with succour, and T&#363;rvay&#257;&#7751;a with thine aid, O Indra. Thou madest Kutsa, Atithigva, &#256;yu, subject unto this King, the young, the mighty.</p><p>May we protected by the Gods hereafter remain thy very prosperous friends, O Indra. Thee we extol, enjoying through thy favour life long and joyful and with store of heroes.  </p>
