<h1>HYMN VII. Indra.</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn">
<p>INDRA the singers with high praise, Indra reciters with their lauds, Indra the choirs have glorified.</p><p>Indra hath ever close to him his two bay steeds and word-yoked car, Indra the golden, thunder-armed.</p><p>Indra hath raised the Sun on high in heaven, that he may see afar: He burst the mountain for the kine.</p><p>Help us, O Indra, in the frays, yea, frays, where thousand spoils are gained, with awful aids, O awful One.</p><p>In mighty battle we invoke Indra, Indra in lesser fight, the Friend who bends his bolt at fiends.</p><p>Unclose, our manly Hero, thou for ever bounteous, yonder cloud, for us, thou irresistible.</p><p>Still higher, at each strain of mine, thunder-armed Indra's praises rise: I find no laud worthy of him.</p><p>Even as the bull drives on the herds, he drives the people with his might, the Ruler irresistible:</p><p>Indra who rules with single sway men, riches, and the fivefold race of those who dwell upon the earth.</p><p>For your sake from each side we call Indra away from other men: Ours, and none others&#146;, may he be.  </p>
