<h1>HYMN XXIV. Varu&#7751;a and Others.</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn">
<p>WHO now is he, of whose auspicious name we may bethink us? Who shall to mighty Aditi restore us, that I may see my Father and my Mother?</p><p>Agni the God the first among the Immortals,&#151;of his auspicious name let us bethink us.</p><p>He shall to mighty Aditi restore us, that I may see my Father and my Mother.</p><p>To thee, O Savitar, the Lord of precious things, who helpest us Continually, for our share we come&#151;</p><p>Wealth, highly lauded ere reproach hath fallen on it, which is laid, free from all hatred, in thy hands</p><p>Through thy protection may we come to even the height of affluence Which Bhaga hath dealt out to us.</p><p>Ne&#146;er have those birds that fly through air attained to thy high dominion or thy might or spirit; Nor these the waters that flow on for ever, nor hills, abaters of the wind's wild fury.</p><p>Varu&#7751;a, King, of hallowed might, sustaineth erect the Tree's stem in the baseless region. Its rays, whose root is high above, stream downward. Deep may they sink within us, and be hidden.</p><p>King Varu&#7751;a hath made a spacious pathway, a pathway for the Sun wherein to travel. Where no way was he made him set his footstep, and warned afar whate&#146;er afflicts the spirit.</p><p>A hundred balms are thine, O King, a thousand; deep and wide-reaching also be thy favours. Far from us, far away drive thou destruction. Put from us e&#146;en the sin we have committed.</p><p>Whither by day depart the constellations that shine at night, set high in Heaven above us? Varu&#7751;a's holy laws remain unweakened, and through the night the Moon moves on in splendor</p><p>I ask this of thee with my prayer adoring; thy worshipper craves this with his oblation. Varu&#7751;a, stay thou here and be not angry; steal not our life from us, O thou Wide-Ruler.</p><p>Nightly and daily this one thing they tell me, this too the thought of mine own heart repeateth. May he to whom prayed fettered &#346;una&#7717;&#347;epa, may he the Sovran Varu&#7751;a release us.</p><p>Bound to three pillars captured &#346;una&#7717;&#347;epa thus to the &#256;ditya made his supplication. Him may the Sovran Varu&#7751;a deliver, wise, ne&#146;er deceived, loosen the bonds that bind him.</p><p>With bending down, oblations, sacrifices, O Varu&#7751;a, we deprecate thine anger: Wise Asura, thou King of wide dominion, loosen the bonds of sins by us committed.</p><p>Loosen the bonds, O Varu&#7751;a, that hold me, loosen the bonds above, between, and under. So in thy holy law may we made sinless belong to Aditi, O thou &#256;ditya.  </p>
