<h1>HYMN LXXIX. Agni.</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn">
<p>HE in mid-air's expanse hath golden tresses; a raging serpent, like the rushing tempest: Purely refulgent, knowing well the morning; like honourable dames, true, active workers.</p><p>Thy well-winged flashes strengthen in their manner, when the black Bull hath bellowed round about us. With drops that bless and seem to smile he cometh: the waters fall, the clouds utter their thunder.</p><p>When he comes streaming with the milk of worship, conducting by directest paths of Order Aryaman, Mitra, Varu&#7751;a, Parijman fill the hide full where lies the nether press-stone.</p><p>O Agni, thou who art the lord of wealth in kine, thou Son of Strength, Vouchsafe to us, O J&#257;tavedas, high renown.</p><p>He, Agni, kindled, good and wise, must be exalted in our song: Shine, thou of many forms, shine radiantly on us.</p><p>O Agni, shining of thyself by night and when the morning breaks, Burn, thou whose teeth are sharp, against the R&#257;k&#7779;asas.</p><p>Adorable in all our rites, favour us, Agni, with thine aid, when the great hymn is chanted forth.</p><p>Bring to us ever-conquering wealth, wealth, Agni, worthy of our choice, In all our frays invincible.</p><p>Give us, O Agni, through thy grace wealth that supporteth all our life, Thy favour so that we may live.</p><p>O Gotama, desiring bliss present thy songs composed with care To Agni of the pointed flames.</p><p>May the man fall, O Agni, who near or afar assaileth us: Do thou increase and prosper us.</p><p>Keen and swift Agni, thousand-eyed, chaseth the R&#257;k&#7779;asas afar: He singeth, herald meet for lauds.  </p>
