<h1>HYMN XLIV. Agni.</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn">
<p>IMMORTAL J&#257;tavedas, thou many-hued fulgent gift of Dawn, Agni, this day to him who pays oblations bring the Gods who waken with the morn.</p><p>For thou art offering-bearer and loved messenger, the charioteer of sacrifice: Accordant with the A&#347;vins and with Dawn grant us heroic strength and lofty fame.</p><p>As messenger we choose to-day Agni the good whom many love, Smoke-bannered spreader of the light, at break of day glory of sacrificial rites.</p><p>Him noblest and most youthful, richly worshipped guest, dear to the men who offer gifts, Him, Agni J&#257;tavedas, I beseech at dawn that he may bring the Gods to us.</p><p>Thee, Agni, will I glorify, deathless nourisher of the world, Immortal, offering-bearer, meet for sacred food, preserver, best at sacrifice.</p><p>Tell good things to thy praiser, O most youthful God, as richly worshipped, honey-tongued, and, granting to Praska&#7751;va lengthened days of life, show honour to the Heavenly Host.</p><p>For the men, Agni, kindle thee as all possessor and as Priest; So Agni, much-invoked, bring hither with all speed the Gods, the excellently wise,</p><p>At dawn of day, at night, U&#7779;as and Savitar, the A&#347;vins, Bhaga, Agni's self: Skilled in fair rites, with Soma poured, the Ka&#7751;vas light thee, the oblation-wafting God.</p><p>For, Agni, Lord of sacrifice and messenger of men art thou: Bring thou the Gods who wake at dawn who see the light, this day to drink the Soma juice.</p><p>Thou shonest forth, O Agni, after former dawns, all visible, O rich in light. Thou art our help in battle-strife, the Friend of man, the great high priest in sacrifice.</p><p>Like Manu, we will stablish thee, Agni, performer of the rite, Invoker, ministering Priest, exceeding wise, the swift immortal messenger.</p><p>When as the Gods&#146; High Priest, by many loved, thou dost their mission as their nearest Friend, then, like the far-resounding billows of the flood, thy flames, O Agni, roar aloud.</p><p>Hear, Agni, who hast ears to hear, with all thy train of escort Gods; Let Mitra, Aryaman, seeking betimes our rite, seat them upon the sacred grass.</p><p>Let those who strengthen Law, who bountifully give, the life-tongued Maruts, hear our praise. May Law-supporting Varu&#7751;a with the A&#347;vins twain and U&#7779;as, drink the Soma juice.  </p>
