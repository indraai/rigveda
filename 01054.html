<h1>HYMN LIV. Indra.</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn">
<p>URGE us not, Maghavan, to this distressful fight, for none may comprehend the limit of thy strength. Thou with fierce shout hast made the woods and rivers roar: did not men run in crowds together in their fear?</p><p>Sing hymns of praise to &#346;akra, Lord of power and might; laud thou and magnify Indra who heareth thee, Who with his daring might, a Bull exceeding strong in strength, maketh him master of the heaven and earth.</p><p>Sing forth to lofty Dyaus a strength-bestowing song, the Bold, whose resolute mind hath independent sway. High glory hath the Asura, compact of strength, drawn on by two Bay Steeds: a Bull, a Car is he.</p><p>The ridges of the lofty heaven thou madest shake; thou, daring, of thyself smotest through &#346;ambara, when bold with gladdening juice, thou warredst with thy bolt, sharp and two-edged, against the banded sorcerers.</p><p>When with a roar that fills the woods, thou forcest down on wind's head the stores which &#346;u&#7779;&#7751;a kept confined, Who shall have power to stay thee firm and eager-souled from doing still this day what thou of old hast done?</p><p>Thou helpest Narya, Turva&#347;a, and Yadu, and Vayya's son Turv&#299;ti, &#346;atakratu! Thou helpest horse and car in final battle thou breakest down the nine-and-ninety castles.</p><p>A hero-lord is he, King of a mighty folk, who offers free oblations and promotes the Law, Who with a bounteous guerdon welcomes hymns of praise: for him flows down the abundant stream below the sky.</p><p>His power is matchless, matchless is his wisdom; chief, through their work, be some who drink the Soma, Those, Indra, who increase the lordly power, the firm heroic strength of thee the Giver.</p><p>Therefore for thee are these abundant beakers Indra's drink, stone-pressed juices held in ladles. Quaff them and satisfy therewith thy longing; then fix thy mind upon bestowing treasure.</p><p>There darkness stood, the vault that stayed the waters&#146; flow: in V&#7771;tra's hollow side the rain-cloud lay concealed. But Indra smote the rivers which the obstructer stayed, flood following after flood, down steep declivities.</p><p>So give us, Indra, bliss-increasing glory give us great sway and strength that conquers people. Preserve our wealthy patrons, save our princes; vouchsafe us wealth and food with noble offspring.  </p>
