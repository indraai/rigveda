<h1>HYMN XCVI. Agni.</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn">
<p>HE in the ancient way by strength engendered, lo! straight hath taken to himself all wisdom. The waters and the bowl have made him friendly. The Gods possessed the wealth bestowing Agni.</p><p>At &#256;yu's ancient call he by his wisdom gave all this progeny of men their being, and, by refulgent light, heaven and the waters. The Gods possessed the wealth. bestowing Agni.</p><p>Praise him, ye &#256;ryan folk, as chief performer of sacrifice adored and ever toiling, Well-tended, Son of Strength, the Constant Giver. The Gods possessed the wealth bestowing Agni.</p><p>That M&#257;tari&#347;van rich in wealth and treasure, light-winner, finds a pathway for his offspring. Guard of our folk, Father of earth and heaven. The Gods possessed the wealth bestowing Agni.</p><p>Night and Dawn, changing each the other's colour, meeting together suckle one same Infant: Golden between the heaven and earth he shineth. The Gods possessed the wealth bestowing Agni.</p><p>Root of wealth, gathering-place of treasures, banner of sacrifice, who grants the suppliant's wishes: Preserving him as their own life immortal, the Gods possessed the wealth-bestowing Agni.</p><p>Now and of old the home of wealth, the mansion of what is born and what was born aforetime, Guard of what is and what will be hereafter,&#151;the Gods possessed the wealth bestowing Agni.</p><p>May the Wealth-Giver grant us conquering riches; may the Wealth-Giver grant us wealth with heroes. May the Wealth-Giver grant us food with offspring, and length of days may the Wealth-Giver send us.</p><p>Fed with our fuel, purifying Agni, so blaze to us auspiciously for glory. This prayer of ours may Varu&#7751;a grant, and Mitra, and Aditi and Sindhu, Earth and Heaven.  </p>
