<h1>HYMN CXLV. Agni.</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>Ask ye of him for he is come, he knoweth it; he, full of wisdom, is implored, is now implored.</p><p>With him are admonitions and with him commands: he is the Lord of Strength, the Lord of Power and Might.</p><p>They ask of him: not all learn by their questioning what he, the Sage, hath grasped, as ’twere, with his own mind. Forgetting not the former nor the later word, he goeth on, not careless, in his mental power.</p><p>To him these ladles go, to him these racing mares: he only will give ear to all the words I speak. All-speeding, victor, perfecter of offerings, the Babe with flawless help hath mustered vigorous might.</p><p>Whate’er he meets he grasps and then runs farther on, and straightway, newly born, creeps forward with his kin. He stirs the wearied man to pleasure and great joy what time the longing gifts approach him as he comes.</p><p>He is a wild thing of the flood and forest: he hath been laid upon the highest surface. He hath declared the lore of works to mortals, Agni the Wise, for he knows Law, the Truthful.</p>
