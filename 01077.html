<h1>HYMN LXXVII. Agni.</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn">
<p>How shall we pay oblation unto Agni? What hymn, Godloved, is said to him refulgent? Who, deathless, true to Law, mid men a herald, bringeth the Gods as best of sacrificers?</p><p>Bring him with reverence hither, most propitious in sacrifices, true to Law, the herald; For Agni, when he seeks the Gods for mortals, knows them full well and worships them in spirit.</p><p>For he is mental power, a man, and perfect; he is the bringer, friend-like, of the wondrous. The pious &#256;ryan tribes at sacrifices address them first to him who doeth marvels.</p><p>May Agni, foe-destroyer, manliest Hero, accept with love our hymns and our devotion. So may the liberal lords whose strength is strongest, urged by their riches, stir our thoughts with vigour.</p><p>Thus Agni J&#257;tavedas, true to Order, hath by the priestly Gotamas been lauded. May he augment in them splendour and vigour: observant, as he lists, he gathers increase.  </p>
