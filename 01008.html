<h1>HYMN VIII. Indra.</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn">
<p>INDRA, bring wealth that gives delight, the victor's ever-conquering wealth, Most excellent, to be our aid;</p><p>By means of which we may repel our foes in battle hand to hand, By thee assisted with the car.</p><p>Aided by thee, the thunder-armed, Indra, may we lift up the bolt, and conquer all our foes in fight.</p><p>With thee, O India, for ally with missile-darting heroes, may We conquer our embattled foes.</p><p>Mighty is Indra, yea supreme; greatness be his, the Thunderer: Wide as the heaven extends his power</p><p>Which aideth those to win them sons, who come as heroes to the fight, Or singers loving holy thoughts.</p><p>His belly, drinking deepest draughts of Soma, like an ocean swells, Like wide streams from the cope of heaven.</p><p>So also is his excellence, great, vigorous, rich in cattle, like A ripe branch to the worshipper.</p><p>For verily thy mighty powers, Indra, are saving helps at once Unto a worshipper like me.</p><p>So are his lovely gifts; let lauds and praises be to Indra sung, That he may drink the Soma juice.  </p>
