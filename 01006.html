<h1>HYMN VI. Indra.</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn">
<p>They who stand round him as he moves harness the bright, the ruddy Steed The lights are shining in the sky.</p><p>On both sides to the car they yoke the two bay coursers dear to him, Bold, tawny, bearers of the Chief.</p><p>Thou, making light where no light was, and form, O men: where form was not, Wast born together with the Dawns.</p><p>Thereafter they, as is their wont, threw off the state of babes unborn, Assuming sacrificial names.</p><p>Thou, Indra, with the Tempest-Gods, the breakers down of what is firm, Foundest the kine even in the cave.</p><p>Worshipping even as they list, singers laud him who findeth wealth, The far-renowned, the mighty One.</p><p>Mayest thou verily be seen coming by fearless Indra's side: Both joyous, equal in your sheen.</p><p>With Indra's well beloved hosts, the blameless, hastening to heaven, The sacrificer cries aloud.</p><p>Come from this place, O Wanderer, or downward from the light of heaven: Our songs of praise all yearn for this.</p><p>Indra we seek to give us help, from here, from heaven above the earth, Or from the spacious firmament.  </p>
