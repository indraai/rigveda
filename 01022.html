<h1>HYMN XXII. A&#347;vins and Others</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn">
<p>WAKEN the A&#347;vin Pair who yoke their car at early morn: may they Approach to drink this Soma juice.</p><p>We call the A&#347;vins Twains borne in a noble car, the best of charioteers, who reach the heavens.</p><p>Dropping with honey is your whip, A&#347;vins, and full of pleasantness Sprinkle therewith the offering.</p><p>As ye go thither in your car, not far, O A&#347;vins, is the home Of him who offers Soma juice.</p><p>For my protection I invoke the golden-handed Savitar.</p><p>He knoweth the place.</p><p>That he may send us succour, praise the Waters&#146; Offspring Savitar: Fain are we for his holy ways.</p><p>We call on him. On Savitar who looks on men.</p><p>Come hither, friends, and seat yourselves Savitar, to be praised by us, giving good gifts, is beautiful.</p><p>O Agni and Tva&#7779;&#7789;ar, to the Soma draught.</p><p>Most youthful Agni, Hotr&#257;, Bh&#257;rat&#299;, Var&#363;tr&#299;, Dhi&#7779;a&#7751;&#257;, for aid.</p>

<p>May Heaven and Earth, the Mighty Pair, bedew for us our offering, and feed us full with nourishments.</p><p>Their water rich with fatness, there in the Gandharva's steadfast place, the singers taste through sacred songs.</p><p>Thornless be thou, O Earth, spread wide before us for a dwelling-place: Vouchsafe us shelter broad and sure.</p><p>The Gods be gracious unto us even from the place whence Vi&#7779;&#7751;u strode Through the seven regions of the Earth!</p><p>Through all this world strode Vi&#7779;&#7751;u; thrice his foot he planted, and the whole Was gathered in his footstep's dust.</p><p>Vi&#7779;&#7751;u, the Guardian, he whom none deceiveth, made three steps; thenceforth establishing his high decrees.</p><p>Look ye on Vi&#7779;&#7751;u's works, whereby the Friend of Indra, close-allied, Hath let his holy ways be seen.</p><p>The princes evermore behold that loftiest place where Vi&#7779;&#7751;u is, laid as it were an eye in Heaven.</p><p>This, Vi&#7779;&#7751;u's station most sublime, the singers, ever vigilant, Lovers of holy song, light up.  </p>
