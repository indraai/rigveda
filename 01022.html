<h1>HYMN XXII. Aśvins and Others</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>WAKEN the Aśvin Pair who yoke their car at early morn: may they Approach to drink this Soma juice.</p><p>We call the Aśvins Twains borne in a noble car, the best of charioteers, who reach the heavens.</p><p>Dropping with honey is your whip, Aśvins, and full of pleasantness Sprinkle therewith the offering.</p><p>As ye go thither in your car, not far, O Aśvins, is the home Of him who offers Soma juice.</p><p>For my protection I invoke the golden-handed Indra.</p><p>He knoweth the place.</p><p>That he may send us succour, praise the Waters’ Offspring Indra: Fain are we for his holy ways.</p><p>We call on him. On Indra who looks on men.</p><p>Come hither, friends, and seat yourselves Indra, to be praised by us, giving good gifts, is beautiful.</p><p>O Agni and Tvaṣṭar,H.</p><p>Most youthful Agni, Hotrā, Bhāratī, Varūtrī, Dhiṣaṇā, for aid.</p>
<p>Indrāṇī, Varuṇānī, and Agnāyī hither I invite, for weal,  juice.</p><p>May Heaven and Earth, the Mighty Pair, bedew for us our offering, and feed us full with nourishments.</p><p>Their water rich with fatness, there in the Gandharva's steadfast place, the singers taste through sacred songs.</p><p>Thornless be thou, O Earth, spread wide before us for a dwelling-place: Vouchsafe us shelter broad and sure.</p><p>The Devas be gracious unto us. Through the seven regions of the Earth!</p><p>Through all this world strode Viṣṇu; thrice his foot he planted, and the whole Was gathered in his footstep's dust.</p><p>Viṣṇu, the Guardian, he whom none deceiveth, made three steps; thenceforth establishing his high decrees.</p><p>Look ye on Viṣṇu's works, whereby the Friend of Indra, close-allied, Hath let his holy ways be seen.</p><p>The princes evermore behold that loftiest place where Viṣṇu is, laid as it were an eye in Heaven.</p><p>This, Viṣṇu's station most sublime, the singers, ever vigilant, Lovers of holy song, light up.</p>
