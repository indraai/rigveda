<h1>HYMN XL. Brahma&#7751;aspati</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn">
<p>O BRAHMA&#7750;ASPATI, stand up: God-serving men we pray to thee. May they who give good gifts, the Maruts, come to us. Indra, most swift, be thou with them.</p><p>O Son of Strength, each mortal calls to thee for aid when spoil of battle waits for him. O Maruts, may this man who loves you well obtain wealth of good steeds and hero might.</p><p>May Brahma&#7751;aspati draw nigh, may S&#363;n&#7771;t&#257; the Goddess come, and Gods bring to this rite which gives the five-fold gift the Hero, lover of mankind.</p><p>He who bestows a noble guerdon on the priest wins fame that never shall decay. For him we offer sacred hero-giving food, peerless and conquering easily.</p><p>Now Brahma&#7751;aspati speaks forth aloud the solemn hymn of praise, Wherein Indra and Varu&#7751;a, Mitra, Aryaman, the Gods, have made their dwelling place.</p><p>May we in holy synods, Gods! recite that hymn, peerless, that brings felicity. If you, O Heroes, graciously accept this word, may it obtain all bliss from you.</p><p>Who shall approach the pious? who the man whose sacred grass is trimmed? The offerer with his folk advances more and more: he fills his house with precious things.</p><p>He amplifies his lordly might, with kings he subdues: e&#146;en mid alarms he dwells secure In great or lesser fight none checks him, none subdues,&#151;the wielder of the thunderbolt.  </p>
