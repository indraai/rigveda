<h1>HYMN CXLVI. Aranyani.</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn">
<p>GODDESS of wild and forest who seemest to vanish from the sight. How is it that thou seekest not the village? Art thou not afraid?</p><p>What time the grasshopper replies and swells the shrill cicala's voice, Seeming to sound with tinkling bells, the Lady of the Wood exults.</p><p>And, yonder, cattle seem to graze, what seems a dwelling-place appears: Or else at eve the Lady of the Forest seems to free the wains.</p><p>Here one is calling to his cow, another there hath felled a tree: At eve the dweller in the wood fancies that somebody hath screamed.</p><p>The Goddess never subdues, unless some murderous enemy approach. Man eats of savoury fruit and then takes, even as he wills, his rest.</p><p>Now have I praised the Forest Queen, sweet-scented, redolent of balm, The Mother of all sylvan things, who tills not but hath stores of food.  </p>
