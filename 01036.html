<h1>HYMN XXXVI. Agni.</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn">
<p>WITH words sent forth in holy hymns, Agni we supplicate, the Lord Of many families who duly serve the Gods, yea, him whom others also praise.</p><p>Men have won Agni, him who makes their strength abound: we, with oblations, worship thee.</p><p>Our gracious-minded Helper in our deeds of might, be thou, O Excellent, this day.</p><p>Thee for our messenger we choose, thee, the Omniscient, for our Priest. The flames of thee the mighty are spread wide around: thy splendour reaches to the sky.</p><p>The Gods enkindle thee their ancient messenger,&#151;Varu&#7751;a, Mitra, Aryaman. That mortal man, O Agni, gains through thee all wealth, who hath poured offerings unto thee.</p><p>Thou, Agni, art a cheering Priest, Lord of the House, men's messenger: All constant high decrees established by the Gods, gathered together, meet in thee.</p><p>In thee, the auspicious One, O Agni, youthfullest, each sacred gift is offered up: This day, and after, gracious, worship thou our Gods, that we may have heroic sons.</p><p>To him in his own splendour bright draw near in worship the devout. Men kindle Agni with their sacrificial gifts, victorious o&#146;er the enemies.</p><p>V&#7771;tra they smote and slew, and made the earth and heaven and firmament a wide abode. The glorious Bull, invoked, hath stood at Ka&#7751;va's side: loud neighed the Steed in frays for kine.</p><p>Seat thee, for thou art mighty; shine, best entertainer of the Gods. Worthy of sacred food, praised Agni! loose the smoke, ruddy and beautiful to see.</p><p>Bearer of offerings, whom, best sacrificing Priest, the Gods for Manu's sake ordained; Whom Ka&#7751;va, whom Medhy&#257;tithi made the source of wealth, and V&#7771;&#7779;an and Upastuta.</p><p>Him, Agni, whom Medhy&#257;tithi, whom Ka&#7751;va kindled for his rite, Him these our songs of praise, him, Agni, we extol: his powers shine out preeminent.</p><p>Make our wealth perfect thou, O Agni, Lord divine: for thou hast kinship with the Gods. Thou rulest as a King o&#146;er widely-famous strength: be good to us, for thou art great.</p><p>Stand up erect to lend us aid, stand up like Savitar the God: Erect as strength-bestower we call aloud, with unguents and with priests, on thee.</p><p>Erect, preserve us from sore trouble; with thy flame burn thou each ravening demon dead. Raise thou us up that we may walk and live: so thou shalt find our worship mid the Gods.</p><p>Preserve us, Agni, from the fiend, preserve us from malicious wrong. Save us from him who fain would injure us or subdue, most Youthful, thou with lofty light.</p><p>Smite down as with a club, thou who hast fire for teeth, smite thou the wicked, right and left. Let not the man who plots against us in the night, nor any foe prevail o&#146;er us.</p><p>Agni hath given heroic might to Ka&#7751;va, and felicity: Agni hath helped our friends, hath helped Medhy&#257;tithi, hath helped Upastuta to win.</p><p>We call on Ugradeva, Yadu, Turva&#347;a, by means of Agni, from afar; Agni, bring Navav&#257;stva and B&#7771;hadratha, Turv&#299;ti, to subdue the foe.</p><p>Manu hath stablished thee a light, Agni, for all the race of men: Sprung from the Law, oil-fed, for Ka&#7751;va hast thou blazed, thou whom the people reverence.</p><p>The flames of Agni full of splendour and of might are fearful, not to be approached. Consume for ever all demons and sorcerers, consume thou each devouring fiend.  </p>
