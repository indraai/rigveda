<h1>HYMN XX. &#7770;bhus.</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn">
<p>FOR the Celestial Race this song of praise which gives wealth lavishly Was made by singers with their lips.</p><p>They who for Indra, with their mind, formed horses harnessed by a word, attained by works of offering.</p><p>They for the two N&#257;satyas wrought a light car moving every way: They formed a nectar-yielding cow.</p><p>The &#7770;bhus with effectual prayers, honest, with constant labour, made Their Sire and Mother young again.</p><p>Together came your gladdening drops with Indra by the Maruts girt, With the &#256;dityas, with the Kings.</p><p>The sacrificial ladle, wrought newly by the God Tva&#7779;&#7789;ar's hand&#151; Four ladles have ye made thereof.</p><p>Vouchsafe us wealth, to him who pours thrice seven libations, yea, to each Give wealth, pleased with our eulogies.</p><p>As ministering Priests they held, by pious acts they won themselves, A share in sacrifice with Gods.  </p>
