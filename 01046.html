<h1>HYMN XLVI. Aśvins.</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>Now Morning with her earliest light shines forth, dear Daughter of the Sky: High, Aśvins, I extol your praise,</p><p>Sons of the Sea, mighty to save discoverers of riches, ye Devas with deep thought who find out wealth.</p><p>Your giant coursers hasten on over the region all in flames,  When your car flies with winged steeds.</p><p>He, liberal, lover of the flood, Lord of the House, the vigilant, Chiefs! with oblations feeds you full.</p><p>Ye have regard unto our hymns, Nāsatyas, thinking of our words: Drink boldly of the Soma juice.</p><p>Vouchsafe to us, O Aśvin Pair, such strength as, with attendant light, May through the darkness carry us.</p><p>Come in the ship of these our hymns to bear you to the hither shore O Aśvins, harness ye the car.</p><p>The Heaven's wide vessel is your own on the flood's shore your chariot waits Drops, with the hymn, have been prepared.</p><p>Kaṇvas, the drops are in the Heaven; the wealth is at the waters' place: Where will ye manifest your form?</p><p>Light came to lighten up the branch, the Sun appeared as it were gold: And with its tongue shone forth the dark.</p><p>The path of offering was made to travel to the farther goal: The road of Heaven was manifest.</p><p>The singer of their praise awaits whatever grace the Aśvins givepath of offering.</p><p>Ye dwellers with Vivasvān come, auspicious come to our offering.</p><p>O circumambient Aśvins, Dawn follows the brightness of your way: Approve with beams our solemn rites.</p><p>Drink ye of our libations, grant protection, O ye Aśvins Twain, with aids which none may interrupt.</p>
