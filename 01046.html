<h1>HYMN XLVI. A&#347;vins.</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn">
<p>Now Morning with her earliest light shines forth, dear Daughter of the Sky: High, A&#347;vins, I extol your praise,</p><p>Sons of the Sea, mighty to save discoverers of riches, ye Gods with deep thought who find out wealth.</p><p>Your giant coursers hasten on over the region all in flames,  When your car flies with winged steeds.</p><p>He, liberal, lover of the flood, Lord of the House, the vigilant, Chiefs! with oblations feeds you full.</p><p>Ye have regard unto our hymns, N&#257;satyas, thinking of our words: Drink boldly of the Soma juice.</p><p>Vouchsafe to us, O A&#347;vin Pair, such strength as, with attendant light, May through the darkness carry us.</p><p>Come in the ship of these our hymns to bear you to the hither shore O A&#347;vins, harness ye the car.</p><p>The heaven's wide vessel is your own on the flood's shore your chariot waits Drops, with the hymn, have been prepared.</p><p>Ka&#7751;vas, the drops are in the heaven; the wealth is at the waters' place: Where will ye manifest your form?</p><p>Light came to lighten up the branch, the Sun appeared as it were gold: And with its tongue shone forth the dark.</p><p>The path of sacrifice was made to travel to the farther goal: The road of heaven was manifest.</p><p>The singer of their praise awaits whatever grace the A&#347;vins give, who save when Soma gladdens them.</p><p>Ye dwellers with Vivasv&#257;n come, auspicious, as to Manu erst; come to the Soma and our praise.</p><p>O circumambient A&#347;vins, Dawn follows the brightness of your way: Approve with beams our solemn rites.</p><p>Drink ye of our libations, grant protection, O ye A&#347;vins Twain, with aids which none may interrupt.  </p>
