<h1>HYMN CLXXX. Aśvins.</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>LIGHTLY your coursers travel through the regions when round the sea of air your car is flying.</p><p>Your golden fellies scatter drops of moisture: drinking the sweetness ye attend the Mornings.</p><p>Ye as ye travel overtake the Courser who flies apart, the Friend of man, most holy. May convey you to support and strengthen.</p><p>Ye have deposited in the raw cow the first milk of the milch-cow. Which the bright offerer presents to you.</p><p>Ye made the fierce heat to be full of sweetness, like streaming water. Fire-offering thence is yours, O Aśvins, Heroes: your car-wheels speed to us like springs of honey.</p><p>May I, ye Mighty, bring you to give your gifts with milk-oblations. Your greatness compasseth Earth, Heaven, and Waters, ye Holy.</p><p>When, Bounteous Ones, ye drive your yoked team downward, ye send, by your own natures, understanding. Swift as the wind let the prince please and feast you.</p><p>For verily we truthful singers praise you the niggard trafficker is here excluded. Now, even now do ye O blameless Aśvins, ye Mighty, guard the man whose Deva is near him.</p><p>You of a truth day after day, O Aśvins, that he might win the very plenteous torrent famous among mortal heroes, roused with a thousand lauds like sounds of music.</p><p>When with the glory of your car ye travel, when we go speeding like the Monk of mortals. May we gain our share of riches.</p><p>With songs of praise we call to-day, O Aśvins, that your new chariot, for our own well-being, that circles Heaven with never-injured fellies. May we find strengthening food in full abundance.</p>
