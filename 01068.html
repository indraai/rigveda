<h1>HYMN LXVIII. Agni.</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn">
<p>COMMINGLING, restless, he ascends the sky, unveiling nights and all that stands or moves, as he the sole God is preeminent in greatness among all these other Gods.</p><p>All men are joyful in thy power, O God, that living from the dry wood thou art born. All truly share thy Godhead while they keep, in their accustomed ways, eternal Law.</p><p>Strong is the thought of Law, the Law's behest; all works have they performed; he quickens all. Whoso will bring oblation, gifts to thee, to him, bethinking thee, vouchsafe thou wealth.</p><p>Seated as Priest with Manu's progeny, of all these treasures he alone is Lord. Men yearn for children to prolong their line, and are not disappointed in their hope.</p><p>Eagerly they who hear his word fulfil his wish as sons obey their sire's behest. He, rich in food, unbars his wealth like doors: he, the House-Friend, hath decked heaven's vault with stars.  </p>
