<h1>HYMN LXI. Indra.</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>EVEN to him, swift, strong and high. exalted, I bring my song of praise as dainty offerings, My thought to him resistless, praise-deserving, prayers offered most especially to Indra.</p><p>Praise, like oblation, I present, and utter aloud my song, my fair hymn to the Victor.</p><p>For Indra, who is Lord of old, the singers have decked their lauds with heart and mind and spirit.</p><p>To him then with my lips mine adoration, winning Heaven's light, most excellent, I offer, to magnify with songs of invocation and with fair hymns the Lord, most bounteous Giver.</p><p>Even for him I frame a laud, as fashions the wright a chariot for the man who needs it,— Praises to him who gladly hears our praises, a hymn well-formed, all-moving, to wise Indra.</p><p>So with my tongue I deck, to please that Indra, my hymn, as ’twere a horse, through love of glory, to reverence the Hero, bounteous Giver, famed far and wide, destroyer of the castles.</p><p>Even for him hath Tvaṣṭar forged the thunder, most deftly wrought, celestial, for the battle, Wherewith he reached the vital parts of Vṛtra, striking-the vast, the mighty with the striker.</p><p>As soon as, at libations of his mother, great Viṣṇu had drunk up the draught, he plundered. The dainty cates, the cooked mess; but One stronger transfixed the wild boar, shooting through the mountain.</p><p>To him, to Indra, Consorts of the Devas, wove praises. The mighty Heaven and Earth hath he encompassed: thy greatness Heaven and Earth, combined, exceed not.</p><p>Yea, of a truth, his magnitude surpasseth the magnitude of Earth, mid-air, and Heaven. Indra, approved by all men, self-resplendent, waxed in his home, loud-voiced and strong for battle.</p><p>Through his own strength Indra with bolt of thunder, he let the floods go free, like cows imprisoned, for glory, with a heart inclined to bounty.</p><p>The rivers played, through his impetuous splendour, since with his bolt he compassed them on all sides. Using his might and favouring him who worshipped, he made a ford.</p><p>Vast, with thine ample power, with eager movement cast thy bolt of thunder. Rend thou  with bolt oblique, that floods of rain may follow.</p><p>Sing with new lauds his exploits wrought aforetime, the deeds of him, yea, him who moveth swiftly, when, hurling forth his weapons in the battle, he with impetuous wrath lays low the foemen.</p><p>When he, yea, he, comes forth the firm. Set mountains and the whole Heaven and Earth. Ever praising the protection of that dear Friend, gain quickly strength heroic.</p><p>Now unto him of these things hath been given what he who rules alone o’er much, electeth.</p><p>Thus to thee, Indra, yoker of Bay Coursers, we have brought our offerings to thee. Bestory upon us thought, decked with all beauty. May he, enriched with meditation, come soon and early.</p>
