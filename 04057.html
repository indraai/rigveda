<h1>HYMN LVII. Ksetrapati, Etc.</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn">
<p>WE through the Master of the Field, even as through a friend, obtain What nourisheth our kine and steeds. In such may he be good to us.</p><p>As the cow yieldeth milk, pour for us freely, Lord of the Field, the wave that beareth sweetness, Distilling meath, well-purified like butter, and let the. Lords of holy Law be gracious.</p><p>Sweet be the plants for us. the heavens, the waters, and full of sweets for us be air's mid-region. May the Field's Lord for us be full of sweetness, and may we follow after him uninjured.</p><p>Happily work our steers and men, may the plough furrow happily. Happily be the traces bound; happily may he ply the goad.</p><p>&#346;una and S&#299;ra, welcome ye this laud, and with the milk which ye have made in heaven Bedew ye both this earth of ours.</p><p>Auspicious S&#299;t&#257;, come thou near: we venerate and worship thee That thou mayst bless and prosper us and bring us fruits abundantly.</p><p>May Indra press the furrow down, may P&#363;&#7779;an guide its course aright. May she, as rich in milk, be drained for us through each succeeding year.</p><p>Happily let the shares turn up the plough-land, happily go the ploughers with the oxen. With meath and milk Parjanya make us happy. Grant us prosperity, &#346;una and S&#299;ra.  </p>
