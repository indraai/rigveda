<p>WE choose Agni the messenger, the herald, master of all wealth, Well skilled in this our offering.</p><p>With callings ever they invoke Agni, Agni, Lord of the House, Oblation-bearer, much beloved.</p><p>Bring the Gods hither, Agni, born for him who strews the sacred grass: Thou art our herald, meet for praise.</p><p>Wake up the willing Gods, since thou, Agni, performest embassage: Sit on the sacred grass with Gods.</p><p>O Agni, radiant One, to whom the holy oil is poured, burn up our enemies whom fiends protect.</p><p>By Agni&nbsp;Agni is inflamed, Lord of the House, wise, young, who bears The gift: the ladle is his mouth.</p><p>Praise Agni in the offering, the Sage whose ways are ever true, the God who driveth grief away.</p><p>God, Agni, be his strong defence who lord of sacrificial gifts, Worshippeth thee the messenger.</p><p>Whoso with sacred gift would fain call Agni to the feast of Gods, O Purifier, favour him.</p><p>Such, Agni, Purifier, bright, bring hither to our offering, to our oblation bring the Gods.</p><p>So lauded by our newest song of praise bring opulence to us, and food, with heroes for our sons.</p><p>O Agni, by effulgent flame, by all invokings of the Gods, show pleasure in this laud of ours.  </p>
