<h1>HYMN XVII. Indra</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>I CRAVE help from the Imperial Lords, from Indra; may they Both favour one of us like me.</p><p>Guardians of men, ye ever come with ready succour at the call Of every singer such as I.</p><p>Sate you, according to your wish, O Indra, with wealth: Fain would we have you nearest us.</p><p>May we be sharers of the powers, sharers of the benevolence. Of you who give strength bounteously.</p><p>Indra and Indra, among givers of thousands, meet for praise, Are Powers who merit highest laud.</p><p>Through their protection may we gain great store of wealth, and heap it up enough and still to spare, be ours.</p><p>O Indra, on you for wealth in many a form I call.</p><p>O Indra, through our songs that seek to win you to ourselves, Give us at once your sheltering help.</p><p>O Indra, to you may fair praise which I offer come, Joint eulogy which ye dignify.</p>
