<h1>HYMN XXVII. Agni.</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn">
<p>WITH worship will I glorify thee, Agni, like a long-tailed steed, Imperial Lord of sacred rites.</p><p>May the far-striding Son of Strength, bringer of great felicity, Who pours his gifts like rain, be ours.</p><p>Lord of all life, from near; from far, do thou, O Agni evermore Protect us from the sinful man.</p><p>O Agni, graciously announce this our oblation to the Gods, and this our newest song of praise.</p><p>Give us a share of strength most high, a share of strength that is below, a share of strength that is between.</p><p>Thou dealest gifts, resplendent One; nigh, as with waves of Sindhu, thou Swift streamest to the worshipper.</p><p>That man is lord of endless strength whom thou protectest in the fight, Agni, or urgest to the fray.</p><p>Him, whosoever he may be, no man may vanquish, mighty One: Nay, very glorious power is his.</p><p>May he who dwells with all mankind bear us with war-steeds through the fight, and with the singers win the spoil.</p><p>Help, thou who knowest lauds, this work, this eulogy to Rudra, him Adorable in every house.</p><p>May this our God, great, limitless, smoke-bannered excellently bright, Urge us to strength and holy thought.</p><p>Like some rich Lord of men may he, Agni the banner of the Gods, Refulgent, hear us through our lauds.</p><p>Glory to Gods, the mighty and the lesser glory to Gods the younger and the elder! Let us, if we have power, pay the God worship: no better prayer than this, ye Gods, acknowledge.  </p>
