<h1>HYMN LXV. Agni.</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn">
<p>ONE-MINDED, wise, they tracked thee like a thief lurking in dark cave with a stolen cow: Thee claiming worship, bearing it to Gods: there nigh to thee sate all the Holy Ones.</p><p>The Gods approached the ways of holy Law; there was a gathering vast as heaven itself. The waters feed with praise the growing Babe, born nobly in the womb, the seat of Law.</p><p>Like grateful food, like some wide dwelling place, like a fruit-bearing hill, a wholesome stream. Like a steed urged to run in swift career, rushing like Sindhu, who may check his course?</p><p>Kin as a brother to his sister floods, he eats the woods as a King eats the rich. When through the forest, urged by wind, he spreads, verily Agni shears the hair of earth.</p><p>Like a swan sitting in the floods he pants wisest in mind mid men he wakes at morn. A Sage like Soma, sprung from Law, he grew like some young creature, mighty, shining far.  </p>
