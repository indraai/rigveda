<h1>HYMN XI. Indra.</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn">
<p>ALL sacred songs have magnified Indra expansive as the sea, The best of warriors borne on cars, the Lord, the very Lord of strength.</p><p>Strong in thy friendship, Indra, Lord of power and might, we have no fear. We glorify with praises thee, the never-conquered conqueror.</p><p>The gifts of Indra from of old, his saving succours, never fail, When to the praise-singers he gives the boon of substance rich in kine.</p><p>Crusher of forts, the young, the wise, of strength unmeasured, was he born Sustainer of each sacred rite, Indra, the Thunderer, much-extolled.</p><p>Lord of the thunder, thou didst burst the cave of Vala rich in cows. The Gods came pressing to thy side, and free from terror aided thee,</p><p>I, Hero, through thy bounties am come to the flood addressing thee. Song-lover, here the singers stand and testify to thee thereof.</p><p>The wily &#346;u&#7779;&#7751;a, Indra! thou o&#146;erthrewest with thy wondrous powers. The wise beheld this deed of thine: now go beyond their eulogies.</p><p>Our songs of praise have glorified Indra who ruleth by his might, Whose precious gifts in thousands come, yea, even more abundantly.  </p>
