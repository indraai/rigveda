<h1>HYMN CLXXXI. Aśvins</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>WHAT, dearest Pair, is this in strength and riches that ye as Monks are bring from the waters? This sacrifice is your glorification, ye who protect mankind and give them treasures.</p><p>May your pure steeds, rain-drinkers, bring you hither, swift as the tempest, your celestial coursers, Rapid as thought, with fair backs, full of vigour, resplendent in their native light, O Aśvins.</p><p>Your car is like a torrent rushing downward. May it come nigh, broad-seated, for our welfare,— Car holy, strong, that ever would be foremost, thought-swift, which ye, for whom we long, have mounted.</p><p>Here sprung to life, they both have sung together, with bodies free from stain, with signs that mark them; One of you Prince of Sacrifice, the Victor, the other counts as Heaven's auspicious offspring.</p><p>May your car-seat, down-gliding, golden-coloured, according to your wish approach our dwellings.</p><p>Men shall feed full the bay steeds of the other, and, Aśvins they with roars shall stir the regions.</p><p>Forth comes your strong Bull like a cloud of autumn, sending abundant food of liquid sweetness. Let them feed with the other's ways and vigour: the upper streams have come and do us service.</p><p>Your constant song hath been sent forth, Disposers! that flows threefold in mighty strength, O Aśvins. Thus lauded, give the suppliant protection moving or resting hear mine invocation.</p><p>This song of bright contents for you is swelling in the men's hall where three-fold grass is ready. Your strong rain-cloud, ye Mighty Ones, hath swollen, honouring men as ’twere with milk's outpouring.</p><p>The prudent worshipper praises you as he praises Dawn and Agni, when, singing with devotion, he invokes you. May we find strengthening food in full abundance.</p>
