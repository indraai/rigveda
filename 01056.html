<h1>HYMN LVI. Indra.</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn">
<p>FOR this man's full libations held in ladles, he hath roused him, eager, as a horse to meet the mare. He stays his golden car, yoked with Bay Horses, swift, and drinks the Soma juice which strengthens for great deeds.</p><p>To him the guidance-following songs of praise flow full, as those who seek gain go in company to the flood. To him the Lord of power, the holy synod's might, as to a hill, with speed, ascend the loving ones.</p><p>Victorious, great is he; in manly battle shines, unstained with dust, his might, as shines a mountain peak; Wherewith the iron one, fierce e&#146;en against the strong, in rapture, fettered wily &#346;ush&#7751;a fast in bonds.</p><p>When Strength the Goddess, made more strong for help by thee, waits upon Indra as the Sun attends the Dawn, then. he who with his might unflinching kills the gloom stirs up the dust aloft, with joy and triumphing.</p><p>When thou with might, upon the framework of the heaven, didst fix, across, air's region firmly, unremoved, In the light-winning war, Indra, in rapturous joy, thou smotest V&#7771;tra dead and broughtest floods of rain.</p><p>Thou with thy might didst grasp, the holder-up of heaven, thou who art mighty also in the seats of earth. Thou, gladdened by the juice, hast set the waters free, and broken V&#7771;tra's stony fences through and through.  </p>
