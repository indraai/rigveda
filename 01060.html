<h1>HYMN LX. Agni.</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn">
<p>As &#146;twere Some goodly treasure M&#257;tari&#347;van brought, as a gift, the glorious Priest to Bh&#7771;gu, Banner of sacrifice, the good Protector, child of two births, the swiftly moving envoy.</p><p>Both Gods and men obey this Ruler's order, Gods who are worshipped, men who yearn and worship. As Priest he takes his seat ere break of morning, House-Lord, adorable with men, Ordainer.</p><p>May our fair praise, heart-born, most recent, reach him whose tongue, e&#146;en at his birth, is sweet as honey; Whom mortal priests, men, with their strong endeavour, supplied with dainty viands, have created.</p><p>Good to mankind, the yearning Purifier hath among men been placed as Priest choice-worthy. May Agni be our Friend, Lord of the Household, protector of the riches in the dwelling.</p><p>As such we Gotamas with hymns extol thee, O Agni, as the guardian Lord of riches, Decking thee like a horse, the swift prizewinner. May he, enriched with prayer, come soon and early.  </p>
