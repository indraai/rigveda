<h1>HYMN XLVII. Aśvins.</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>AŚVINS, for you who strengthen Law this sweetest Soma hath been shed.</p><p>Drink this expressed ere yesterday and give riches to him who offers it.</p><p>Come, O ye Aśvins, mounted on your triple car three-seated, beautiful of form To you at offerings the Kaṇvas send the prayer: graciously listen to their call.</p><p>O Aśvins, ye who strengthen Law, drink ye this sweetest Soma juice. Borne on your wealth-fraught car come ye this day to him who offers, ye of wondrous deeds.</p><p>Omniscient Aśvins, on the thrice-heaped grass bedew with the sweet juice the offering. The sons of Kaṇva, striving heavenward, call on you with draughts of Soma juice out-poured.</p><p>O Aśvins, with those aids wherewith ye guarded Kaṇva carefully, Keep us, O Lords of Splendour: drink the Soma juice, ye strengtheners of holy law.</p><p>O Mighty Ones, ye gave Sudās abundant food, brought on your treasure-laden car; So now vouchsafe to us the wealth which many crave, either from Heaven or from the sea.</p><p>Nāsatyas, whether ye be far away or close to Turvaśa, Borne on your lightly-rolling chariot come to us, together with the sunbeams come.</p><p>So let your coursers bring you to our libations here. Bestowing food on him who acts and gives aright, sit, Chiefs, upon the sacred grass.</p><p>Come, O Nāsatyas, on your car decked with a sunbright canopy, Whereon ye ever bring wealth to the worshipper, 's pleasant juice.</p><p>With lauds and songs of praise we call them down to us, that they, most rich, may succour us; For ye have ever in the Kaṇvas' well-loved house, O Aśvins.</p>
