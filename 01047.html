<h1>HYMN XLVII. A&#347;vins.</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn">
<p>A&#346;VINS, for you who strengthen Law this sweetest Soma hath been shed. Drink this expressed ere yesterday and give riches to him who offers it.</p><p>Come, O ye A&#347;vins, mounted on your triple car three-seated, beautiful of form To you at offerings the Ka&#7751;vas send the prayer: graciously listen to their call.</p><p>O A&#347;vins, ye who strengthen Law, drink ye this sweetest Soma juice. Borne on your wealth-fraught car come ye this day to him who offers, ye of wondrous deeds.</p><p>Omniscient A&#347;vins, on the thrice-heaped grass bedew with the sweet juice the offering. The sons of Ka&#7751;va, striving heavenward, call on you with draughts of Soma juice out-poured.</p><p>O A&#347;vins, with those aids wherewith ye guarded Ka&#7751;va carefully, Keep us, O Lords of Splendour: drink the Soma juice, ye strengtheners of holy law.</p><p>O Mighty Ones, ye gave Sud&#257;s abundant food, brought on your treasure-laden car; So now vouchsafe to us the wealth which many crave, either from heaven or from the sea.</p><p>N&#257;satyas, whether ye be far away or close to Turva&#347;a, Borne on your lightly-rolling chariot come to us, together with the sunbeams come.</p><p>So let your coursers, ornaments of sacrifice, bring you to our libations here. Bestowing food on him who acts and gives aright, sit, Chiefs, upon the sacred grass.</p><p>Come, O N&#257;satyas, on your car decked with a sunbright canopy, Whereon ye ever bring wealth to the worshipper, to drink the Soma's pleasant juice.</p><p>With lauds and songs of praise we call them down to us, that they, most rich, may succour us; For ye have ever in the Ka&#7751;vas' well-loved house, O A&#347;vins, drunk the Soma juice.  </p>
