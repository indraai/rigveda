<h1>HYMN LXIII. Indra.</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn">
<p>THOU art the Mighty One; when born, O Indra, with power thou terrifiedst earth and heaven; When, in their fear of thee, all firm-set mountains and monstrous creatures shook like dust before thee.</p><p>When thy two wandering Bays thou drawest hither, thy praiser laid within thine arms the thunder, Wherewith, O Much-invoked, in will resistless, thou smitest foemen down and many a castle.</p><p>Faithful art thou, these thou defiest, Indra; thou art the &#7770;bhus' Lord, heroic, victor. Thou, by his side, for young and glorious Kutsa, with steed and car in battle slewest &#346;u&#7779;&#7751;a,</p><p>That, as a friend, thou furtheredst, O Indra, when, Thunderer, strong in act, thou crushedst V&#7771;tra; When, Hero, thou, great-souled, with easy conquest didst rend the Dasyus in their distant dwelling.</p><p>This doest thou, and art not harmed, O Indra, e&#146;en in the anger of the strongest mortal. Lay thou the race-course open for our horses: as with a club, subdue, Thunder-armed! our foemen.</p><p>Hence men invoke thee, Indra, in the tumult of battle, in the light-bestowing conflict. This aid of thine, O Godlike One, was ever to be implored in deeds of might in combat.</p><p>Warring for Purukutsa thou, O Indra, Thunder-armed! breakest down the seven castles; Easily, for Sud&#257;s, like grass didst rend them, and out of need, King, broughtest gain to P&#363;ru.</p><p>O Indra, God who movest round about us, feed us with varied food plenteous as water&#151; Food wherewithal, O Hero, thou bestowest vigour itself to flow to us for ever.</p><p>Prayers have been made by Gotamas, O Indra, addressed to thee, with laud for thy Bay Horses. Bring us in noble shape abundant riches. May he, enriched with prayer, come soon and early.  </p>
