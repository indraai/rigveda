<h1>HYMN X. Indra.</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>THE chanters hymn thee, they who say the word of praise magnify thee.</p><p>The Monks have raised thee up on high, like a pole.</p><p>As up he clomb from ridge to ridge and looked upon the toilsome task, Indra observes this wish of his, and the Rain hastens with his troop.</p><p>Harness thy pair of strong bay steeds, long-maned, whose bodies fill the girths, and, Indra, Soma-drinker, come to listen to our songs of praise.</p><p>Come hither, answer thou the song, sing in approval, cry aloud. Good Indra, make our meditation succeed, and prosper this our offering.</p><p>To Indra must a laud be said, to strengthen him who freely gives in our friendship and water-offerings.</p><p>Him, him we seek for friendship, him for riches and heroic might. For Indra, he is Åšakra, he shall aid us while he gives us wealth.</p><p>Easy to turn and drive away, Indra, is spoil bestowed by thee. Unclose the stable of the kine, and give us wealth O Thunder-armed</p><p>The Heaven and Earth contain thee not, together, in thy wrathful mood. Win us the waters of the sky, and send us kine abundantly.</p><p>Hear, thou whose ear is quick, my call; take to thee readily my songs O Indra, let this laud of mine come nearer even than thy friend.</p><p>We know thee mightiest of all. Of thee most mighty we invoke the aid that giveth thousandfold.</p><p>O Indra, enjoy our offering with delight. Prolong our life anew, and cause the seer to win a thousand gifts.</p><p>Lover of song, may these our songs on every side encompass thee: Strengthening thee of lengthened life, may they be dear delights to thee.</p>
