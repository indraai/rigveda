<h1>HYMN CXLVIII. Agni.</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn"><p>WHAT Mātariśvan, piercing, formed by friction, Herald of all the Devas. in varied figure, is he whom they have set mid human houses, gay-hued as light and shining forth for beauty.</p><p>They shall not harm the man who brings thee praises: such as I am, Agni my help approves me.</p><p>All acts of mine shall they accept with pleasure, laudation from the singer who presents it.</p><p>Him in his constant seat men skilled in worship have taken and with praises have established. As, harnessed to a chariot fleet-foot horses, at his command let bearers lead him forward.</p><p>Wondrous, full many a thing he chews and crunches: he shines amid the wood with spreading brightness. Upon his glowing flames the wind blows daily, driving them like the keen shaft of an archer.</p><p>Him, whom while yet in embryo the hostile, both skilled and fain to harm. May never injure, Men blind and sightless through his splendour hurt not: his never-failing lovers have preserved him.</p>
