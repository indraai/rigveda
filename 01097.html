<h1>HYMN XCVII. Agni.</h1>
<article class="feecting-box hymn">
<p>CHASING with light our sin away, O Agni, shine thou wealth on us. May his light chase our sin away.</p><p>For goodly fields, for pleasant homes, for wealth we sacrifice to thee. May his light chase our sin away.</p><p>Best praiser of all these be he; foremost, our chiefs who sacrifice. May his light chase our sin away.</p><p>So that thy worshippers and we, thine, Agni, in our sons may live. May his light chase our sin away.</p><p>As ever-conquering Agni's beams of splendour go to every side, May his light chase our sin away.</p><p>To every side thy face is turned, thou art triumphant everywhere. May his light chase our sin away.</p><p>O thou whose face looks every way, bear us past foes as in a ship. May his light chase our sin away.</p><p>As in a ship, convey thou us for our advantage o&#146;er the flood. May his light chase our sin away.  </p>
